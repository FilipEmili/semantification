VMount Rose Ski Tahoe is the closest ski resort to Reno, Nevada. And the only ski resort that offers a 360 degree view into Nevada's Truckee Meadows and Lake Tahoe. At the top of the peak on a clear day one can see a unique transition of arid desert to the east and lush evergreen forest of the Sierra Mountain Range to the west. The Resort is located about 30 miles (50 km) south of Reno in the Carson Range. Mt. Rose is Tahoe's highest base elevation at about 8,260 ft (2,520 m) and the summit is 9,700 ft (3,000 m). The resort area is 1,200 acres (4.9 km2), and is located in the Toiyabe National Forest. Despite the name, the resort is actually on the slopes of Slide Mountain rather than Mount Rose, which is on the other side of Nevada State Route 431. The resort first opened in 1953, starting with the "Reno Ski Bowl" located on the east face of Slide Mountain. Later renamed to the "Slide Mountain Ski Area", it operated side-by-side with the "Mount Rose Ski Area", opened in 1964 on the north side of Slide Mountain. The two areas merged in 1987. On January 26, 2016, it was reported that the business is being sold.
