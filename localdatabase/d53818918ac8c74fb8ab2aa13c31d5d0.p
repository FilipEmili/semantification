VSheridan County Airport (IATA: SHR, ICAO: KSHR, FAA LID: SHR) is a county owned, public use airport in Sheridan County, Wyoming, United States. It is located two nautical miles (4 km) southwest of the central business district of Sheridan, Wyoming. The airport is mainly used for general aviation. Sheridan once again has scheduled passenger service with nonstop flights to Denver (DEN) operated by Key Lime Air as Denver Air Connection using 30 seat Fairchild Dornier 328JET regional jet aircraft. Recent past air service was subsidized by the federal Essential Air Service program until February 2007, when Big Sky Airlines began providing subsidy free service The Big Sky service was suspended in January 2008 when this air carrier went out of business. Great Lakes Airlines was the only other carrier serving Sheridan however this carrier abruptly ceased all flights on March 31, 2015 due to a lack of pilots created by recently implemented stringent rules placed on airline pilot qualifications. Many Sheridan residents were confused regarding the lack of replacement service, believing that service to Sheridan was still subsidized under Essential Air Service. Federal law had been changed in 2012 so that once Sheridan County had left the EAS program, it could not re-enter it and any future commercial air service to Sheridan will be not be funded by EAS. As per Federal Aviation Administration records, the airport had 17,710 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 14,181 enplanements in 2009, and 14,146 in 2010. It is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011\u20132015, which categorized it as a primary commercial service airport (more than 10,000 enplanements per year).
