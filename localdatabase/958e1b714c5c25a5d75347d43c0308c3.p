VDoing Time, Doing Vipassana is a 1997 Israeli independent documentary film project by two women filmmakers from Israel, Ayelet Menahemi and Eilona Ariel about the use of Vipassanaas taught by S. N. Goenka as a rehabilitation method and its impact on foreign and Indian prisoners which was then known as one of the harshest prisons in the world. The film inspired other correctional facilities such as the North Rehabilitation Facility in Seattle to use Vipassana as a means of rehabilitation.
