VZagreb Commuter Rail is the suburban/commuter railway network that provides mass-transit service in the city of Zagreb, Croatia and its suburbs. This suburban rail system is operated by Croatian Railways (Croatian: Hrvatske \u017eeljeznice, H\u017d), and has been in development since 1992. With 21 trains the Suburban Railway mainly covers the eastern and western parts of Zagreb. The railway stations have been renovated and the train services have been made more regular in Zagreb. These measures have contributed to the betterment of the suburban railway service. Since the system started operating, the lines have been serviced by H\u017d series 6111 EMUs built by Ganz. Since 2011, new H\u017d series 6112-1 (suburban version) cars were added as well. In 2005, suburban rail services were increased to approximately 15-minute frequency on the main line Savski Marof \u2013 Zagreb Central Station \u2013 Dugo Selo. A new link to the nearby town of Samobor has been announced. This link will be standard-gauge and tie in with normal Croatian Railways operations (the previous narrow-gauge line to Samobor was closed in 1979).
