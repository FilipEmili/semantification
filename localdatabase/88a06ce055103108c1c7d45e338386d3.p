VCainscross is a suburban community in Gloucestershire, England, on the western outskirts of Stroud. It is well served with local amenities, including a Post Office and a large supermarket. It is well connected to Stroud (only a twenty-minute walk away), Cheltenham and Gloucester with frequent bus services. The Stroudwater Canal is easily accessible, as is Selsley Common. The population of Cainscross was 6,680 (in 2001) of which 14.6% are in the 5\u201314 age group. The area is predominantly white (98.4%) with a high proportion of lone parent households with dependent children in comparison to the Stroud and county averages. 18.8% of the household rent from a social landlord, 6.2% of household are claiming housing benefit, and 22.4% of households have no car \u2013 again all much higher than the county or Stroud profiles. Lone pensioner households are also high at 18.2% with smaller proportions of people providing unpaid care, and higher social service referrals for the over 75s than elsewhere. Low levels of burglary, theft of motor vehicles, the numbers of serious and fatal road traffic accidents than the county average. The percentage of young offenders resident in the area and of children with low scores at key stages 1\u20133, are also below the Stroud and county averages. The Parish Council is hoping to improve provision of community and youth facilities; these, along with levels of open space, were identified in the 2006 Parish Plan as key issues along with library, post office and evening bus services. The site of a former hospital is being redeveloped with community consultation involving a Bristol-based company with a strong regeneration record. A new Children\u2019s Centre is being developed on the nearby Cashes Green Primary school site.
