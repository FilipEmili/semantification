VA melam (or mathalam) is a type of percussion instrument that is unique to Tamil Nadu, Kerala and parts of South India. Those who plays melam are called 'Melakaar'. In ancient Tamilakam (Tamil country) melam was used for all the occasions in temples (Kovil Melam, Naiyandi Melam, Urumi Melam), marriages (Ketti Melam), functions, funeral wake(Parai Melam). In Kerala the most traditional of all melams is the Pandi Melam, which is generally performed outside the temple. Another melam called the Panchari Melam, which is similar to Pandi Melam, but the Panchari Melam is played inside the temple.
