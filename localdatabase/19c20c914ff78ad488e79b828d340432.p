VSouth Higgins Lake State Park is a 1,000-acre (4.0 km2) state park in Roscommon County, Michigan. The park opened in 1927 with 15 campsites and has since been expanded to 400 campsites, one of the largest in the state park system. The park has one mile of Higgins Lake shoreline and surrounds Marl Lake. County Road 104 runs through the park. Most park development is in the 300-acre (120 ha) section between Higgins Lake and CR 104. The 700-acre (280 ha) Marl Lake section is less developed and has 5.5 miles (8.9 km) of hiking trails. The park has a mixed pine, oak, maple forest. Hunting is allowed in portions of the park. Bird species include nesting bald eagles, migratory loons, kingfisher and turkey.
