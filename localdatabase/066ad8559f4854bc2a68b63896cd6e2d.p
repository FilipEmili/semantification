VLost Trail Powder Mountain is an alpine ski area in the western United States, on the Montana-Idaho border in the northern Rocky Mountains. In the Bitterroot Range, it is at the junction of US Highway 93 and Montana State Highway 43 at Lost Trail Pass, about one mile (1.6 km) northwest of Chief Joseph Pass, which is on the Continental Divide. The summit elevation of Saddle Mountain is 8,200 feet (2,500 m) above sea level with a vertical drop of 1,800 feet (550 m). The main base area, which includes the parking lot and lodge, is at 7,000 feet (2,134 m) and in Montana, as are the majority of the runs. Chairlift #1 runs approximately along the Idaho-Montana border; the terrain to its south, including Chairlift #2, is in Idaho. Until 2003, the top of Chair #1 & Chair #2 was the summit of the area, at 7,800 feet (2,380 m), and the vertical drop was 1,200 feet (370 m). When chairlift #3 (Huckleberry) was added on the Montana side in 2002, it lowered the base by 200 vertical feet (60 m). The addition of Chair #4 on Saddle Mountain, which opened in February 2003 after delays, increased the area's vertical drop by 400 feet (120 m). The slopes on the mountain are primarily east-facing. The ski area is known for high snow accumulations but is primarily a day area, used mainly by local residents. It is open four days per week (Thursday through Sunday) and holidays. The business office is to the north in Montana at Conner, about midway to Hamilton.
