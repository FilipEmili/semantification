VRoxanne Lizette "Roxy" Mitchell (previously Slater and Moon) is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera EastEnders, portrayed by Rita Simons. Roxy arrived in Walford with her sister Ronnie (played by Samantha Womack) on 24 July 2007 and decided to move permanently to Walford from Ibiza where they ran a bar together. Roxy is the younger of the two sisters. She is described as the "fire", as opposed to Ronnie's "ice". Simons took a temporary hiatus in 2015, with Roxy off screen from 1 January  until 4 May 2016. In August 2016, it was announced that Simons would be departing along with Womack. It was later reported that Roxy and Ronnie will both be killed-off, although this has not officially been confirmed by show bosses. During Roxy's time on the show she has been married twice - to Sean Slater (Robert Kazinsky) and Alfie Moon (Shane Richie) - and engaged an additional three times - to Damian (James Hiller), Aleks Shirovs (Kristian Kiehling) and Dean Wicks (Matt Di Angelo). Her major storylines have included the paternity of her daughter Amy Mitchell (Abbie Knowles), becoming landlady of The Queen Victoria, becoming a millionairess before squandering all the money on frivolous spending, her popular friendship with Christian Clarke (John Partridge), a feud with Alfie's ex-wife Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace), one-night stands with both her sister's husbands (Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) and Charlie Cotton (Declan Bennett), Dean's rape attempt of her, and becoming a drugs mule. The character has proved popular with viewers, with Simons winning the "Best Newcomer" award at the Digital Spy Soap Awards in 2008 for her role in the soap opera.
