VThe Google barges are a group of four floating barges built between 2010 and 2012, commissioned by Google to serve as "an interactive space where people can learn about new technology", possibly as luxury showrooms for Google Glass and other products on an invitation-only basis. As of March 2014, two of the barges are docked in the Port of Stockton in Stockton, California after being forced to leave the San Francisco Bay. Another barge, formerly docked in Portland, Maine, was reported in August 2014 to have been sold. Two of the barges (one San Francisco barge and the former Portland barge) have or had a superstructure consisting of four stories of modern shipping containers welded together. Most of these containers have small slits that may serve as windows. Each superstructure had a container that slants down to ground level at a shallow angle. CBS sources claimed that the first three floors were intended to serve as a showroom, while the upper floor was designated as a party deck. The San Francisco structure has poles at the top that may be antennas, and was described as eventually being decorated with gigantic sails, and being moved among sites in the San Francisco Bay Area as a "temporary technology exhibit space" to "drive visitation to the waterfront". The other two barges are owned by the same corporation (set up by Google) but do not have a superstructure. Google may have built the structures on barges to avoid mandatory city building permits and public plans that may disclose their purpose.
