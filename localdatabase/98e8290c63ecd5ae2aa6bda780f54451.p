VThe Wairaurahiri River is a river in southern Fiordland, New Zealand, draining Lake Hauroko into the sea.Many boats have got into trouble along its length, as the river flows quite quickly with grade-3 rapids, so the main boats that use the river are commercial jetboats. There is a 157-metre (515 ft) drop from the source at Lake Hauroko to the mouth, which empties into Foveaux Strait. There is an active stoat and rat trapping programme set up along the length of the river and maintained by locals.
