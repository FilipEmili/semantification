VOviedo High School is a grade 9-12 public secondary school set on a 52-acre (210,000 m2) campus in Oviedo, Florida, a community situated in southeastern Seminole County operated by Seminole County Public Schools. The \u201cOviedo School\u201d was established in 1932 as a comprehensive K-through-12 educational facility; members of the first graduating class received their diplomas in 1935. The secondary grades separated from the elementary in 1948, and the upper level, which moved to the current site in 1969, became Oviedo High School, now one of the oldest schools in Central Florida. The school recently underwent a $50 million renovation project. The school newspaper is the "Lion's Tale", an award-winning paper recognized by the National Scholastic Press Association, the Columbia Scholastic Press Association, and the Florida Scholastic Press Association.
