VThe R14 was a New York City Subway car built in 1949 by the American Car and Foundry Company. They were a "follow-up" or supplemental stock for the A Division's R12s and look exactly the same, except for a different floor pattern. These were the last cars built with outside door operating apparatus or controls. Delivery began in August 1949, with R14s entering service on the 7 (IRT Flushing Line) service in September 1949  with all 150 cars delivered by January 1950. The R14s ran on the Flushing Line there until the arrival of the R33/R36 World's Fair cars in late 1963-early 1964. Afterwards, the R14s were transferred to operate on other A division routes before being retired and replaced by the R62/R62As on December 10, 1984. While they ran in solid consists on the Flushing line, the R14s never did so on the mainlines, always being intermixed in trains of newer cars and were never placed at the conductor's location.
