VThe Eggleston School is former school and current private residential structure located at the 10539 Nolan Road in rural Nester Township in southeastern Roscommon County, Michigan. It was designated as a Michigan Historic Site on February 29, 1996 and soon after added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 4, 1996. It is the only property in Roscommon County listed on the National Register and one of only four county properties designated as a Michigan Historic Site\u200a\u2014\u200aalong with Gerrish Township Information Site, Pioneer House, and Turney House. Located at the corner of Nolan Road and Muma Road in section 19 of the very sparsely populated Nester Township, the masonry structure was built in 1934 to serve as a schoolhouse for the few residents of the township. The school included two classrooms upstairs and large open space on the first floor as a gymnasium, auditorium, and cafeteria. The school and its property were financed by the township's largest landowner, Mary Eggleston. It stands on five acres (2.3 ha) of land that also includes a small cemetery, which contains only three graves, located near the structure. At some point, the school was decommissioned and converted into a private residential structure. The few students in the area now attend Houghton Lake Community Schools about 20 miles (32 km) northwest in Houghton Lake.
