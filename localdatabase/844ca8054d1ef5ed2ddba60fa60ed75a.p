VGot is the name of the world's first cloned fighting bull who was born on Tuesday, May 18, 2010 in Spain by a team from the Prince Felipe Research Center and the Valencia Foundation for Veterinary Research. He was cloned from another fighting bull named Vasito, and scientists are hoping that he displays similar fighting characteristics of his "father". The project of cloning a fighting bull took three years, in part because scientist struggled with how to preserve "valuable bull genes" Animal rights activists have vocally denounced the cloning of the bull saying that it "leads to the genetic manipulation of a species, with the twisted objective of maintaining the falsehood that bulls are fighters by nature," Although he is the first Fighting Bull Got is not the first ever bull clone, that honor is believed to be bestowed on "Second Chance" who was born in 1999.
