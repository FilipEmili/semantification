VThe Larwood Bridge is a covered bridge near Lacomb in Linn County in the U.S. state of Oregon. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. The bridge crosses Crabtree Creek at Larwood Wayside Park, where the Roaring River empties into the creek, about 3 miles (5 km) north of Lacomb. The 105-foot (32 m) bridge carries Fish Hatchery Road over the creek. Built in 1939, the bridge was repaired in 2002. It was named after William Larwood, who settled here in 1888, built a store and blacksmith shop, and operated a post office. The bridge had two predecessors, one over the creek and another over the river, adjacent to one another. Both no longer exist.
