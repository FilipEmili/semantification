VMiguel Gutierrez is an American dance and music artist born in 1971. Currently based in Brooklyn, New York, he spent the early part of his career performing in San Francisco as a member of the Joe Goode Performance Group. He makes solo works and also works with collaborators as 'Miguel Gutierrez and the Powerful People'. His work tends towards the emotional and concerns itself with the phenomenon of existence. His fascinations lie with the body's ability to move between the mundane and the transcendent. His research also focuses on how the presence of the audience creates a space of attention and extraordinary perception. His work has been presented in the Whitney Biennial in 2014, the Dance Theater Workshop, The Kitchen, MIX: The NY Lesbian and Gay Experimental Film Festival, Diverseworks in Houston, TX, the Flynn Center in Burlington, VT, and internationally in festivals such as ImPuls Tanz in Vienna, Springdance Festival in Utrecht and Touch:2005 in Archangel, Russia. Gutierrez received a 2010 Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award. May 2016 the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation named Gutierrez a recipient of the Performing Artist Award, a grant "to empower, invest in and celebrate artists.... intended as deepened investments in the artists\u2019 personal and professional development and future work."
