VDouglas "Doug" Willis  is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera Neighbours, played by Terence Donovan. Doug was introduced by executive producer Don Battye as the patriarch of the newly introduced Willis family. Donovan explained that being part of "a loving family" was one of the main reasons he accepted the role. He said he was happy to stay around for as long as the producers wanted him. Donovan made his first screen appearance as Doug during the episode broadcast on 18 July 1990. Doug was portrayed as a man's man, down-to-earth, easy-going and friendly. Doug was a builder, who loved his family and enjoyed spending time with his friends. Despite being "an easy touch" as a father, Doug could balance understanding with discipline. Doug and his wife, Pam (Sue Jones) had a solid marriage until they began to neglect each other due to work. When Doug thought Pam was having an affair with their neighbour Jim Robinson (Alan Dale), he ended up having a one-night stand with Jill Weir (Lyn Semler). Doug's father, Bert (Bud Tingwell), was introduced in 1993. They had had a difficult relationship, but Doug made amends with his father when he learned he was dying. Shortly after, Doug got into debt and lost his job, causing him to sink into a deep depression. One of Doug's last storylines saw him suffer a health scare in which he had to undergo an emergency operation. The character departed on 15 September 1994, after being written out. In July 2005, Donovan reprised his role as part of the show's 20th anniversary celebrations. He reprised the role again in April 2014 and Doug came to Ramsay Street to visit his family. He was also diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Doug continued to make guest appearances until his death in April 2016, with his storylines mostly focusing on the progression of his Alzheimer's and how it affects him and his family.
