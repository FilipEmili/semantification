VTernhill (also known as Tern Hill) is a village in Shropshire, England, notable as the location of the former RAF Ternhill station, which is now operated by the British Army and known as Clive Barracks. The settlement is named after the River Tern which begins just south of the settlement. The population for the village as taken in the 2011 census can be found under Moreton Say. The A41 and A53 cross over at the village and there is now a roundabout. It has direct links with major towns and cities such as Shrewsbury, Wolverhampton, Stoke-on-Trent and Chester. Shropshire's second commercial vineyard in modern times is nearby.
