VBarnsley Building Society was established on 12 January 1853, by a group of prominent townsfolk who following the example of many other towns and cities at the time decided to form their own building society. The society became part of the Yorkshire Building Society in 2008, and has since continued as a trading division. In 2016, the Yorkshire announced it would replace the Barnsley Building Society brand with its own, close six branches and rebrand the remainder under its own brand.
