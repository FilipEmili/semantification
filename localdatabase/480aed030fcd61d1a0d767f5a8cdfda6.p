VThe 1935\u201336 season was the 61st season of competitive football in England. Sunderland AFC won the league, and in doing so they remain the last team to win the English League while wearing striped jerseys. They also equalled the record of six titles won by Aston Villa. Aston Villa and Blackburn Rovers were relegated from the 1st Division and therefore became the last two of the founder members of the Football League to lose top flight status for the first time.
