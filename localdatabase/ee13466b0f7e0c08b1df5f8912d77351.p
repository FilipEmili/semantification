VFredrick Monroe Taylor (February 25, 1901 \u2013 February 16, 1988) was a federal judge in Idaho for over 33 years. Born in Nampa, Idaho, Taylor graduated from Nampa High School and attended the University of Idaho in Moscow. He was a member of Sigma Nu fraternity and received an LL.B. from the UI College of Law in 1926. Taylor was in private practice in Valley County from 1927 to 1938, and a prosecuting attorney of Valley County from 1927 to 1933, and from 1935 to 1938, returning to private practice in Boise from 1938 to 1954. He was a member of the Idaho Senate from 1943 to 1951, and was a city attorney of Boise from 1944 to 1946. Taylor was the campaign manager for Herman Welker in 1950, who was elected to the U.S. Senate. In 1954, Taylor was nominated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on July 9 to a new seat on the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho created by 68 Stat. 8. He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on July 20 and received his commission the same day. He served as chief judge from 1964 to 1971, and assumed senior status on December 15, 1971, serving in that capacity for over 16 years, until his death in 1988 at age 86.
