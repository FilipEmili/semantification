VCaber is one of the Celtic gods of Avalon, a warrior god. The character, created by Tom DeFalco and Ron Frenz, first appeared in Thor #398 (Dec. 1988). Caber joined his friend Leir and the other Celtic gods in aiding the Asgardians in their battle against the forces of the Egyptian god Seth. With Leir, Caber next attacked the camp of the Fomorians, the traditional enemies of Avalon. Leir wished to claim Sif as his bride, so Caber followed him to Asgard on Leir's request. Caber and Leir were captured by the Warriors Three. Caber clashed with Heimdall in Asgard, and then later arrived on Earth with Leir and Sif. Caber, Leir, and Sif then traveled to the Black Galaxy and found Thor there. The gods then traveled to Asgard. Caber, Leir, and Hercules then battled Surtur and Ymir. Caber then witnessed Leir's defeat in Leir's duel with Sif. Caber possesses the typical powers of a member of the race of superhumans known as the Celtic gods of Avalon. This includes superhuman strength, speed, durability, stamina, and reflexes, and an extremely long lifespan. Caber's speed is far greater than that of any other known god of Avalon, and has the ability to run at subsonic speeds for long periods of time.
