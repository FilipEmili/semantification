VThe American Assembly is a public policy institute at Columbia University. It was founded in 1950 by Dwight D. Eisenhower and has become his most enduring achievement and legacy as Columbia University president. For over 60 years, The Assembly has fostered non-partisan public-policy discussions through convening, research, and publication. To-date, over 100 \u2018American Assemblies\u2019 have been held on topics ranging from prison reform to health care to nuclear disarmament. In recent years, Assembly projects have made a wide range of contributions to economic, urban, and cultural policy, including projects on workforce development, financial regulation, and the role of the arts in American universities.
