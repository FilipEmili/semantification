VThe Block is an Australian reality television series broadcast on the Nine Network. The series follows four or five couples as they compete against each other to renovate houses/apartments and sell them at auction for the highest price. The series first ran for two consecutive seasons in 2003 and 2004, and was originally hosted by Australian gardening guru Jamie Durie. The first season was filmed at Bondi and the second at Manly. The Nine Network revived The Block after a six-year absence, with a third season commenced airing on 22 September 2010, this time hosted by television personality and builder Scott Cam. The third season again took place in Sydney, in the suburb of Vaucluse. Moving to Victoria, Australia, the fourth season was filmed in the Melbourne suburb of Richmond, Victoria on Cameron Street. Breaking with tradition, season four was filmed in four side-by-side houses as opposed to an apartment block of four. Season four saw television personality Shelley Craft join Scott Cam in hosting the show. Season five began airing in April 2012. As with season four, season five has retained the four separate houses format, as opposed to four apartments in a single apartment block as in earlier seasons. Season five is again set in Melbourne, on Dorcas Street, and is set in four adjacent multi-storey town houses. Season six returned to Sydney, in Bondi, for the tenth year anniversary, this was the last season that involved renovating houses, as from it's seventh season, the contestants have renovated rundown apartment blocks, rundown buildings and former hotel buildings. The first three seasons of The Block aired once weekly for 13, 26 and 9 weeks respectively. For seasons four, five & six The Block was aired every weeknight, taking on the tagline "7'OBlock Weeknights," and every Sunday night for 8 weeks. Since season 7, the 7'OBlock tagline only occurs on Sunday nights and airs at 7:30 on weeknights. The Block receives new sponsors every season, though their main sponsors include Mitre 10, Suzuki, The Good Guys, Domain & Swisse One of the main furniture and lighting suppliers is Sokol Furniture, a furniture wholesaler based in Melbourne, Australia.

VThe Block (Entre quatro paredes em Portugal) foi um concurso/ reality-show australiano, transmitido pela Nine Network. Apresentado por Jamie Durie, a primeira temporada foi filmada em Bondi e a segunda em Manly, ambas na região de Nova Gales do Sul. O concurso girava à volta das renovações de um bloco de quatro apartamentos por cada um dos quatro casais. A cada duas semanas os casais teriam de projectar, construir e decorar um compartimento com um orçamento que teria de ser controlado para aguentar para os outros seis compartimentos. A cada dois domingos um paínel de três júris ia avaliar o compartimento que teria valorizado mais cada um dos apartamentos, oferecendo ao casal vencedor um prémio que muitas vezes iria ajudar no orçamento individual. Para além disso, os casais teriam de viver nos apartamentos desde o primeiro dia, por entre as obras e as renovações, e de ir trabalhar durante a semana nos seus empregos originais. No final, cada um dos apartamentos iria a um leilão onde o casal que vendesse o apartamento com maior lucro ganhava o prémio de 100 mil dólares australianos.
