VOxon Hill High School (OHHS) is a public senior high school located in Oxon Hill, an unincorporated area in Prince George's County, Maryland, and a suburb of Washington, D.C. in the United States. The school, which serves grades 9 through 12, is a part of the Prince George's County Public Schools system. Oxon Hill is one of three schools in Prince George's county to offer the Science & Technology Program (see below), a magnet program with a highly selective admissions process. This program is a "school within a school" with approximately 125 students in each entering class. Overall, the school has approximately 2,500 students spread across the four grade levels. In recent years, the school has suffered persistent overcrowding due to its popular academic programs, extracurricular activities, and location in the burgeoning southern tier of the county. The school mascot is a Clipper Ship, as chosen through a student contest. The school motto is Navis Semper Naviget (May The Ship Sail Forever).
