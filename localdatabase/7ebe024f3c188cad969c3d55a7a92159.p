VEdward Stewart "Porky" Oliver, Jr. (September 6, 1915 \u2013 September 21, 1961) was a professional golfer from the United States. He played on what is now known as the PGA Tour in the 1940s and 1950s. Born in Wilmington, Delaware, Oliver started as a caddy at age 11 at Wilmington Country Club and turned pro at age 18. He earned his nickname because he stood 5 ft 9 in (1.75 m) but weighed 240 pounds (109 kg). He won eight times on the PGA Tour in the 1940s and 1950s. Oliver was well known for finishing second in several major championships, but not letting it get him down. He lost to Ben Hogan in the finals of the 1946 PGA Championship, was runner-up to Julius Boros in the 1952 U.S. Open, and to Hogan at the 1953 Masters. Oliver also finished in a tie with Lawson Little and Gene Sarazen at the 1940 U.S. Open, but was disqualified for teeing off 30 minutes early over weather concerns (under current rules, tournament directors reserve the rule to advance round start times, group players in three, and using both the first and tenth tees in case of approaching weather). He was the medalist in the stroke play qualifier of the PGA Championship in 1954, but lost in the third round to eventual champion Chick Harbert. Because of his positive attitude, Oliver was a popular player on tour. Oliver played on three Ryder Cup teams (1947, 1951, and 1955). He lost several years of playing time while serving in the U.S. Army during World War II, and suffered from the after effects of a 1948 automobile accident that injured a kidney.
