VThe 1968 Tasman Series was the fifth Tasman Series season. It began on 6 January 1968 and ended on 4 March after eight races. It was won by Jim Clark, driving a Lotus 49T. It was the third and final Tasman Series win for Clark who was killed in a Formula 2 crash on the ultra fast Hockenheim circuit in West Germany just over a month after the series concluded. Clark won the last of his twelve career Tasman Series wins when he won the 1968 Australian Grand Prix at the Sandown Raceway in Melbourne, only 0.1 seconds in front of the Ferrari 246T of Chris Amon after a famous duel between the pair. Reigning 1967 Formula One World Champion Denny Hulme finished equal seventh in the series in his Formula 2 Brabham with a best finish of third in Round 3 for the Lady Wigram Trophy, his first race of the series.
