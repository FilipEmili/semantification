VDonald William Ashworth (born March 16, 1931) is a musician who was a member of The Tonight Show Band for thirty years before retiring in 1995. Ashworth played woodwind instruments with the group starting from Johnny Carson's first week as host of The Tonight Show in October 1962 (when the band was referred to generically as The NBC Orchestra) until his final show on May 22, 1992. For its first 10 years, Carson's Tonight Show was based in New York City with occasional trips to Burbank, California; in May 1972, Ashworth moved from New York City to Southern California when the show moved permanently to Burbank. He was often seen on the show when Carson played "Stump the Band", where studio audience members asked the band to try to play obscure songs given only the title. The Tonight Show had a live band for nearly all of its existence, and Ashworth played under three different band leaders: Skitch Henderson (who had previously led the band during Tonight Starring Steve Allen; see photo), followed briefly by Milton DeLugg, then from 1967 to 1992 by Doc Severinsen (with Tommy Newsom filling in for him when Doc was absent). While playing for The Tonight Show Band, he also played woodwinds for The Carol Burnett Show on CBS for 8 years. He also played for a variety of other television shows, including Dallas, Dynasty, Trapper John M.D., Perry Como's Kraft Music Hall, and The Merv Griffin Show. Ashworth plays all types of flutes, saxophones, oboes, clarinets, recorders, and ocarina. He has two children, Jennifer and Derek. Jennifer is married to Jeff Modisett, who was elected Attorney General of Indiana in 1996.; Derek is married to Nancy Ward.
