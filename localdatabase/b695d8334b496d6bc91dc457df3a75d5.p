VYorktown Heights Railroad Station is a former railroad station on the Putnam Line in Yorktown Heights, New York, United States. It is a wooden building located on Commerce Street at the intersection of Underhill Avenue in Railroad Park. The station was originally built in 1877 by the New York, Westchester and Putnam Railway along a line originally installed by the New York and Boston Railroad that is today a rail trail. It is one of the only three left in Westchester County, and one of only two in that scale and style. In 1981, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the only property listed in the town.
