VKvassheim Lighthouse (Norwegian: Kvassheim fyr) is a coastal lighthouse located on the beach at Kvassheim in Hå municipality in Rogaland county, Norway. The lighthouse is located about 2.5 kilometres (1.6 mi) south of the village of Vigrestad. The original building was established in 1912 and automated in 1984. In 1990, the lighthouse was replaced with a smaller, automated lighthouse located about 70 metres (230 ft) to the west of the old building. The old building is now used as a museum and landmark. The present lighthouse is on a 9.3-metre (31 ft) tall concrete post that is painted with red and white horizontal bands. The light on top sits at an elevation of 11.7 metres (38 ft) above sea level. The 26,400-candela light emits a white, red, or green light (depending on direction) occulting twice every 8 seconds.
