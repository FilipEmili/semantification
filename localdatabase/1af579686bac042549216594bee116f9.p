VDeKalb Avenue is a street in the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, with the majority of its length in Brooklyn. It runs from Woodward Avenue (Linden Hill Cemetery) in Ridgewood, Queens to Fulton Street (Fulton Mall) in Downtown Brooklyn. Between Woodward Avenue and Bushwick Avenue, DeKalb Avenue is a two-way, two-lane street; between Bushwick Avenue and Fulton Street, it is one-way westbound. (Lafayette Avenue is the corresponding parallel one-way street eastbound.) A bike lane, installed in 2004 and extended in 2008, exists between Malcolm X Boulevard and Flatbush Avenue. DeKalb Avenue is named after Baron Johann de Kalb, who served in the American Revolutionary War. Landmarks along the avenue include the Pratt Institute, Fort Greene Park, the Brooklyn Hospital Center, the DeKalb and Marcy branches of the Brooklyn Public Library, Long Island University's Brooklyn Campus, and Junior's. The NYCDOT proposed in 2008 to introduce traffic calming and other improvements to DeKalb Avenue.
