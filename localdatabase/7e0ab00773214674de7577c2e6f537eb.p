VUnion Public Schools is a public school district located in southeast Tulsa, and northwest Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. The school district is the eleventh largest in Oklahoma. Union is notable among school districts in the area because Union does not encompass a particular city. Instead, many of its patrons believe Union is a unifying organization within the community, providing activities for its families, a sense of pride, support and identity for its patrons. Union Public Schools observes a nine-month calendar school year, beginning in mid-August and ending in May. However, the school offers a number of summer programs including traditional summer school classes, driver's education, enrichment classes, and adult education classes. In addition, the district offers an Extended Day Program which provides adult-supervised care for elementary students before and after school, on certain holidays or when the school is closed for professional development days as well as during the summer. Union Public Schools offers a gamut of courses in their secondary curriculum to accommodate both college-bound and non-college-bound students. Options among these courses are Advanced Placement (AP), and concurrent enrollment. These options enable students to earn college credit while fulfilling high school requirements. Students interested in careers or courses in vocational areas are transported to the one of the Tulsa Technology Center campuses for the curriculum they desire. In 2009, Union implemented a new program called the Union Collegiate Academy, in which selected seniors may participate in classes led by instructors from area colleges - including OU-Tulsa, OSU-Tulsa, Tulsa Community College, Northeastern State University, Tulsa Technology Center, University of Tulsa, and Oral Roberts University. The class addresses a myriad of topics such as college selection and scholarship research, project-based learning, professional dress and etiquette, and public relations and leadership skills introducing students to different academic disciplines. The district also a community education program which serves as the \u201cumbrella\u201d for a variety of programs offered in the Green Country area including Tulsa, Broken Arrow and Muskogee. These programs include adult classes funded by the Oklahoma State Department of Education and community programs for both adults and children. Some programs are offered at no cost, others at a nominal fee. Union also offers a host of parent organizations and the Union Public Schools Education Foundation which funds innovative teaching projects to reward and reinforce excellence. Its Board of Education consists of five members elected by district zones for five-year terms.
