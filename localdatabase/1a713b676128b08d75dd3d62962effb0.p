VThe APS Bank, successor of the Unione Cattolica San Giuseppe, is a Maltese bank established in 1910 by a Jesuit, Fr. Michael Vella and in 1948 the bank's ownership was transferred to the Archdiocese of Malta and Gozo. The bank was incorporated into a private limited liability company in 1970 and granted a commercial licence in 1990. Since then it has kept expanding its operations in a number of different directions. Today it employs some 200 staff working in seven branches and agencies across Malta and Gozo. APS Bank holds two subsidiaries, namely APS Consult Ltd and APS Funds Sicav plc. In October 2010, culminating its 100 year anniversary celebrations, the bank inaugurated a modern seven storey Head Office block in Swatar, Birkirkara. APS Bank is an active member of FEBEA - The European Federation of Ethical and Alternative Banks and Financiers.
