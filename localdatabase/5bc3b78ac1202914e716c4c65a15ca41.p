VThe Credit Valley Railway was a historical Canadian railway located in Ontario. Chartered in 1871 by Ontario railway magnate George Laidlaw, it operated as an independent company until 1883 when it was leased by the Ontario and Quebec Railway, a Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) operating company building a network of lines in southern Ontario. The section from Toronto to St. Thomas remains in use as the CPR mainline through Ontario, forming portions of what is now the Galt and Windsor Subdivisions. The branch to Orangeville is currently operated as the Orangeville Brampton Railway. The Elora branch was abandoned and converted to rail trail use.
