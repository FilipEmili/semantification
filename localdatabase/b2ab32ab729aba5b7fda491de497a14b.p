VSletringen Lighthouse (Norwegian: Sletringen fyr) is a lighthouse just off coast of Titran in the municipality of Frøya in Sør-Trøndelag county, Norway. It is Norway's tallest lighthouse. The lighthouse has a secondary light also. The main light is a flashing white light with a two blink pattern and it can be seen for 18 nautical miles (33 km; 21 mi). The secondary light is a white isophase light that can be seen for 14.6 nautical miles (27.0 km; 16.8 mi) The lighthouse is lit from July 21 until May 16 each year. It is not lit during the summer due to the midnight sun in Norway. The lighthouse is also equipped with a foghorn. The lighthouse lost power in 2008, and the power supply has not been restored.
