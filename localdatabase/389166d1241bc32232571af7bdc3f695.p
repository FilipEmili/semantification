VThis list of churches in Rogaland is a list of the Church of Norway churches in Rogaland county, Norway. The churches are all part of the Diocese of Stavanger. The diocese is based at the Stavanger Cathedral in the city of Stavanger. The list is divided into nine sections, one for each Deanery (prosti) in the county. Administratively each deanery is divided up into church council (fellesråd) districts which usually correspond to the municipalities within each deanery. Each municipal church council may be made up of more than one parish (sokn), each of which may have their own council (soknerådet). Each parish may have one or more congregations in it. The city-municipality of Stavanger is a special case. It has a large population, so the central part of the city is its own deanery and the surrounding areas belong to a different deanery although both encompass one municipality. The number, size, and compositions of the deaneries in Stavanger have changed over time, most recently in 2013 when two deaneries were merged to form the new Ryfylke deanery.
