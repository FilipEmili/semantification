VFibrominn, located in Benson, Minnesota, is the first power plant in the United States designed to burn poultry litter as its main source of fuel. It is producing 55 megawatts of electric power and burning turkey manure combined with wood chips. All of the energy is purchased by Xcel Energy. The plant was developed by Fibrowatt LLC, part of the Homeland Renewable Energy Group, which was set up by the management team which built the world's first three poultry-litter-fueled power plants (in the UK). Construction began in 2005 and the plant began operating in 2007, making it the largest biomass power plant in the United States. Grand opening ceremonies were held October 12\u201313, 2007. The plant is now owned by ContourGlobal, LP.
