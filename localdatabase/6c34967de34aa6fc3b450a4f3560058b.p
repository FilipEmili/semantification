VSouthern Cross Catholic College (SCCC) is a co-educational Catholic day school located in the north-eastern Brisbane suburb of Redcliffe in Queensland, Australia. The college opened 30 January 1995 after the amalgamation of several schools on the Redcliffe Peninsula; in particular: De La Salle College - both the Junior and Secondary College (located on Scarborough Road), Frawley College (located on Scarborough Road), Soubirous College, St Bernadette's of Scarborough, Our Lady Help of Christians (of Redcliffe) and Our Lady of Lourdes (Woody Point).

The previous Headmasters were Mr Paul Woodcock, Mrs Robyn Killoran and Mr Greg Myers, the current principal is Mr Brett Horton. The school is built on the old De La Salle College site.
