VThe National School of Government (previously known as the Civil Service College and the Centre for Management and Policy Studies, or CMPS) was the part of the Cabinet Office that ran training, organisational development and consultancy courses for UK civil servants and private individual learners. It was mostly based at Sunningdale Park, near Ascot in Berkshire, but had other centres in Edinburgh and London. National School of Government also managed Sunningdale Institute \u2013 a virtual academy of leading thinkers on management, organisation and governance. The National School of Government closed on 31 March 2012. Very few of its main functions have been taken on by a new body, Civil Service Learning, which is part of the Home Office.
