VThe Wainui River is a river of the Tasman Region of New Zealand's South Island. It flows north through Abel Tasman National Park from its sources on the slopes of Mount Evans to reach the small Wainui Bay, an indentation close to the eastern end of Golden Bay. The sources of Wainui River near Wainui Saddle are close to the Abel Tasman Inland Track. Shortly after, the Wainui Track follows its course for a few kilometers, with Wainui Hut situated next to the river. Almost all of Wainui River's course is through dense native bush, with the lower half meandering through a narrow gorge where the river eventually flows over the 10 metres (33 ft) tall Wainui Falls, one of the most accessible waterfalls in the Tasman region. Wainui Falls can be reached from a car park in Wainui Bay via the gentle Wainui Falls Track.
