VThe Royal Field Artillery (RFA) of the British Army provided close artillery support for the infantry of the British Army. It came into being when created as a separate entity from the Royal Artillery on 1 July 1899, and was re-amalgamated into the Royal Artillery in 1924. The Royal Field Artillery was the largest arm of the artillery. It was responsible for the medium calibre guns and howitzers deployed close to the front line and was reasonably mobile. It was organised into brigades, attached to divisions or higher formations.
