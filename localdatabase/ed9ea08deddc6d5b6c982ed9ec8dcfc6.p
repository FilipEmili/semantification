VJohn Rennie High School (JRHS), located in Pointe-Claire, Quebec, Canada, is an English language secondary school which opened in 1955. The school was named after John Rennie (1904\u20131952), the Union Nationale Member of the Legislative Assembly of Quebec for Huntingdon from 1947 to 1952. Pointe-Claire was and remains in a riding that has voted for the Quebec Liberal Party; thus, when local representatives made their case to Premier Maurice Duplessis for the building of a new high school to meet the needs of the burgeoning post-World War II school population, Premier Duplessis' stipulation for the funding was for the building to be named after his recently deceased fellow Union Nationale MNA and longtime party fundraiser. However, this was not completely a partisan political decision of Premier Duplessis, as John Rennie had been the Assistant Director of Protestant Schools in Pointe-Claire from 1930 to 1936, as well as Principal of the Valois Park and Cedar Park Schools. John Rennie is administered by the Lester B. Pearson School Board.
