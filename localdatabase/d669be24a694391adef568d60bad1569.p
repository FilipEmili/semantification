VAutomatic 7 is an American rock trio. Formed in 1993, they have released three albums to date. They released their debut album self-titled Automatic 7 on November 22, 1995 on BYO Records. Band members John Hulett (vocals and guitar), Nic Nifoussi (bass guitar and vocals) and Ray Mehlbaum (drums) toured North America and Europe with Social Distortion, Bad Religion, Face to Face, Bouncing Souls, Less than Jake, D.O.A., Youth Brigade, Shades Apart, Down By Law, Suicide Machines in addition to various shows with Love and Rockets, Lit, Jimmy Eat World, Reverend Horton Heat and John Doe of X. In 1996 Automatic 7 contributed a cover version of the Psychedelic Furs 'Pretty in Pink' to the Vagrant Records V/A release 'Before You Were Punk' along with other various 80's themed covers by bands such as Blink 182 and Face to Face In 1997 Automatic 7 signed with A&M Records, the band recorded their second album at Long View Farm with legendary Producer Ron Saint Germain. However, as A&M prepared for the release of the second album, PolyGram (A&M Parent label) was bought by Seagram and merged with its MCA Records family to create Universal Music. A&M was subsequently merged into Universal Music Group's then newly formed Interscope-Geffen-A&M label group. All these changes left the band disenchanted with A&M and Automatic 7 split with the label, and the album was never released. However, Automatic 7 signed with Vagrant Records, which was owned and operated by the band's manager Rich Egan and released Beggar's Life on July 25, 2000. Between 2001 and 2006, Automatic 7 went on a hiatus. The band reformed in 2006, and released the album At Funeral Speed in 2007, on the independent label Mental Records. The album was well received and included a rendition of Bruce Springsteen's "Atlantic City". In 2008 Nifoussi and Ray Mehlbaum formed the Noise/Rock duo Killing Bees and subsequently released their self-titled debut on Guano loco/Loose Fang records.
