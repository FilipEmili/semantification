VRoy Alexander McKay (August 1, 1933 \u2013 December 25, 1995) was an aggressive left-handed baseball pitcher born in London, Ontario, Canada, who signed with the Detroit Tigers organization in 1952 after spending much of his youth at Labatt Park, including a stint as batboy for the Ontario Baseball Association champions, the 1945 London Majors of the Intercounty Baseball League. In 1953 and 1955, McKay pitched in Douglas, Georgia, United States, and Idaho Falls, Idaho, before returning to his hometown to play for the Intercounty League's London Majors where he was named the league's most valuable pitcher in 1957. In 1958, McKay's best Intercounty season as a hurler, he had a 2.79 ERA and topped the circuit in hitting batters with pitches at 16. Off the field, McKay was a specifications writer at General Motors Ltd., Diesel Division.
