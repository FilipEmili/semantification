VI Graves sono un gruppo horror punk formato da Michale Graves e Dr. Chud dopo il loro abbandono dai Misfits. I Graves hanno registrato e prodotto un solo album, Web of Dharma, oltre a due demo, una prima ed una successiva al disco. Nessuno di questi due venne pubblicato ufficialmente, nonostante siano stati diffusi tra i fan. Le demo per Web Of Dharma furono registrate nel novembre 2001. Nel settembre 2002, il gruppo si sciolse a causa di divergenze tra Michale e Dr. Chud. Michale formò allora un nuovo gruppo, i Gotham Road, Dr. Chud formò i Dr. Chud's X-Ward, Graham suonò per un breve periodo con i Let it Burn e Tom Logan entrò nei Professional Murder Music.

VGraves is the band that Michale Graves and Dr. Chud formed after they left the Misfits. Graves recorded and released one album, Web of Dharma that was produced by Dr. Chud. The band also recorded a demo before Web of Dharma, which was never officially released. Demos for "Web Of Dharma" were recorded in November 2001. These recordings were produced by Ron Gouldie at June 3 Studios in Los Angeles, CA. The sessions for the album occurred in April 2002 at Spin Studios in Long Island, NY. Overdubbing sessions and final mixing took place in the "Creepy Attic" - Dr. Chud's home studio. A special limited edition of this album was sold at the record release party. The number of copies pressed is still unknown. Seemingly the only difference between the limited edition and the regular edition, is the artwork on the CD itself. Limited edition CD artwork contains the Grave Diggers Union logo. The album's artwork was done by James Rowe. In September 2002, the band broke up. Michale went on to form a new band, Gotham Road, Dr. Chud formed his new band, Dr. Chud's X-Ward, Graham played briefly with Let it Burn, and Tom Logan joined the band Professional Murder Music.
