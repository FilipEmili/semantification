V"All Mixed Up" is a single released by 311. It was on the album 311, also known as The Blue Album. This album was released in 1995 and later went triple platinum, selling over 3 million copies worldwide. The song was co-written by Douglas Vincent "SA" Martinez and Nick Hexum. The duo first started working on the song during the 311 tour supporting Grassroots. After the tour Martinez wrote the lyrics about feeling "confused and being unfaithful" and Hexum took the song's title from an early Elvis Presley interview in which Elvis claimed he was "all mixed up" over his new-found fame. The band often performs a rearranged version of the song that appears on setlists as "All Re-Mixed Up." This song uses elements of the Stalag riddim and also begins with a sample from reggae artist Yellowman's song Mister Chin on the album Mister Yellowman.
