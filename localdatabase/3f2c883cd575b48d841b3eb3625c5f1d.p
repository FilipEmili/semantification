VAmityville Memorial High School is a Public High School located in Amityville, New York on the South Shore of Long Island. The high school is part of the Amityville Union Free School District, which includes the Village of Amityville and portions of North Amityville and East Massapequa. The school follows a basic New York State Regents guideline and offers Advanced Placement (AP) and Syracuse University credited courses. Hip-Hop group De La Soul got their start here, as students of Amityville High School, and released their debut LP 3 Feet High and Rising soon after (1989). Most were still high school students when their first album was released. Also hailing from Amityville is Taking Back Sunday founder, Eddie Reyes.
