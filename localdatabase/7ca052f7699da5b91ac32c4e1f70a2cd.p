VHead Wound City is an American noisegrind supergroup consisting of Jordan Blilie and Cody Votolato of The Blood Brothers, Nick Zinner from Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and Justin Pearson and Gabe Serbian, both from The Locust and Holy Molar. Their debut self-titled EP was released in 2005 on Three One G (both CD and limited 10" vinyl EP), and was written, recorded, and produced all in the time span of one week. Their music is best described as rapid-fire bursts of noise and screams, or as vocalist Jordan Billie puts it, "It's kind of like if Alien and Predator started a band instead of fighting each other."  The songs are typically quite short in length, with the aforementioned EP running less than 10 minutes in seven songs. The lyrics stay as rough as the sound which patterned along with the mathcore and thrashcore result in unique wave of modern punk with similar sound and effect to all of Justin Pearson and Three One G Records projects. The band reunited for a string of shows in 2014 at the request of guitarist Nick Zinner. Shortly afterwards, the band announced they would be recording a new album with producer Ross Robinson who previously worked with Blilie on The Blood Brothers seminal 2002 release ...Burn, Piano Island, Burn.
