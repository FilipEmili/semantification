VDuring the 1800s the American Chestnut (Castanea dentata) was one of the most widespread and useful tree species east of the Mississippi River. By 1940 an estimated 4 billion trees were killed by the blight. The failing of this tree species had a negative impact on the economy of rural Appalachia. In Illinois, the Chestnut has been recorded in the wild in only seven counties, including Jo Daviess \u2014 the only county with Chestnuts in the northern half of the state. This ski resort is located in Galena, Illinois, and 20 miles southeast of Dubuque, Iowa. Galena Illinois is a part of the Jo Daviess county. It is visible from a 10-mile radius. The ski resort opened in 1959 and features two restaurants, a lodge with 119 rooms, an indoor pool and hot tub area, as well as several other accommodations. There are 19 named ski runs: 4 Beginner, 11 Intermediate, 3 Advanced, plus "The Far Side", a snowboarding terrain park. The park has two quad chairs, four triple chairs and three surface lifts that take you to the top. Village Ski Center Chestnut Mountain's 20,000 square foot ski center houses an apparel shop, equipment rental area and ticketing outlet. The apparel shop features Rossignol skis and boots, Burton Snowboards and clothing from Burton and Nordica (company). To truly customize your Midwest skiing experience, The Ski Center Pro Shop also houses a ski school, first aid station and tuning shop. Lastly, the equipment rental area perpetually whisks visitors through 2,400 sets of rental gear and on to the hill where they belong. Chestnut provides a Children's Center and there is an affiliated Chestnut Mountain Race Team. During the warmer seasons the resort operates a mini golf course and a playground, as well as an Alpine Slide served by a ski lift. Boat rides on the Mississippi River are available from the resort from Memorial Day through late October. The Special Olympics of Illinois annually conducts the Winter Special Olympics at Chestnut.
