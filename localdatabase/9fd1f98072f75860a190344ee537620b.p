VWootton Upper School is an academy school located on Hall End Road, in Wootton. It teaches years 9-11 in compulsory education and years 12-13 in post-16 education. Approximately 75% of students previously in compulsory education stay on to the sixth form. The school specialises in Performing Arts, such as Music, Drama and Dance. Wootton Upper School started in 1975. As the school buildings were not quite ready, it shared a site with Stewartby Middle School. The first intake was 213 students and they moved onto the Wootton site in the November, with 16 teaching staff. The first Headmaster was Mr Stanley Clews, with Deputy Head, Mr John Bonerton. The school was complete by 1978. Mr Clews retired in 1987 and then Mrs Catherine Mackenzie took over until 1999, when Mr Anthony Withell became head. in 2014 Mr Michael Gleeson became Principal of the school. The Upper School catchment area covers far more villages than just Wootton and having achieved Beacon Status in 2001, it is regarded as one of the top Upper Schools in the County. The main feeder schools are Holywell and Marston Vale middle schools.
