VThe 1928 Chatham Cup was the sixth annual nationwide knockout football competition in New Zealand.

Teams taking part in the final rounds are known to have included Auckland YMCA, St. Andrews (Manawatu), Northern (Dunedin), Hastings United, Petone (who beat Wellington Marist in the Wellington regional final), and Riccarton.
