VOluvil Lighthouse (Sinhalese: \u0d94\u0dbd\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0dd2\u0dbd\u0dca \u0db4\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0daf\u0dd3\u0db4\u0dcf\u0d9c\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dba) is a lighthouse situated on the southern east coast of Sri Lanka at Oluvil, which is located approximately 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) south of Kalmunai. The lighthouse is operated and maintained by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority. It is the first lighthouse erected after the Sri Lankan independence, until the Hambantota Port and the Colombo Port expansion occurred in 2012-13. The 24 metres (79 ft) high white cylindrical concrete lighthouse tower was built in 1999 as a part of the development of Oluvil Harbour and it was constructed with lantern and gallery, attached to a one story small equipment building. The lighthouse was declared open on 19 June 1999 by then Sri Lanka's Minister for Port Development, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction and the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress leader M. H. M. Ashraff.
