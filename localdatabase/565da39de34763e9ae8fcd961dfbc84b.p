VSilent Coup is a book written by Len Colodny and Robert Gettlin, in which they contend that former Nixon White House counsel John Dean orchestrated the 1972 Watergate burglary at Democratic National Committee headquarters to protect his future wife Maureen Biner by removing information linking her to a call-girl ring that worked for the DNC. The first edition was published in 1991, followed quickly by an expanded second edition in January 1992. The authors also argued that Alexander Haig was not Deep Throat, but was a key source for Bob Woodward, who as a Naval officer had briefed Haig at the White House in 1969 and 1970; it was later revealed FBI deputy director Mark Felt, who was confirmed as Deep Throat in 2005, became Woodward's key source after his partner Carl Bernstein was able to locate hush money in Miami, Florida.
