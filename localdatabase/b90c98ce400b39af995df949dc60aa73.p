VJulian Klymkiw (born July 16, 1933) is a Canadian retired professional ice hockey goaltender who played in one National Hockey League game for the New York Rangers during the 1958\u201359 NHL season. Klymkiw was working as Detroit`s assistant trainer during the October 11, 1958 game between the Rangers and Red Wings at The Olympia. Early in the third period, Rangers goaltender Gump Worsley was tripped up and crashed into his own net, pulling a tendon in his left leg. Worsley was removed from the ice on a stretcher, and the Wings offered the Rangers the use of Klymkiw for the remainder of the game. Klymkiw had been a goaltender during his amateur hockey career and participated in Detroit practices. He entered the game with the Red Wings leading 1-0 and gave up two goals for a 3-0 loss. Klymkiw was also the resident goaltender for the CBS show "Shootout in the NHL", which ran in the gaps between periods of games broadcast by CBS.
