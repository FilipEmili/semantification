VThe Pine Grove Covered Bridge is a covered bridge that spans the East Branch of Octoraro Creek on the border between Lancaster County and Chester County in Pennsylvania, United States. It is the longest covered bridge in Lancaster County. The bridge has a two-span, wooden, double Burr arch truss design with the addition of steel hanger rods. It is the only two-span covered bridge still in use. The other two-span bridge, Herr's Mill Covered Bridge, is located on private property. The bridge's deck is made from oak planks.
