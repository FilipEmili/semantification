VAnthony Daly (born 22 October 1969) is an Irish retired hurler who played as a left wing-back for the Clare senior hurling team. Born in Clarecastle, County Clare, Daly first excelled at hurling during his schooling at St. Flannan's College. He arrived on the inter-county scene when he first linked up with the Clare minor team before later joining the under-21 side. He made his senior debut during the 1989\u201390 National League. Daly subsequently became a regular member of the starting fifteen and won two All-Ireland medals and three Munster medals. He captained the team to the All-Ireland title in 1995 and 1997. As a member of the Munster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions, Daly won two Railway Cup medals. At club level he is a one-time Munster medallist with Clarecastle. In addition to this he also won five championship medals. Throughout his career Daly made 30 championship appearances. He announced his retirement from inter-county hurling on 21 February 2002. His uncles, Haulie and John Daly, also played hurling with Clare. Daly is widely regarded as one of Clare's all-time greatest and most popular players. During his playing days he won three All-Star awards, while he was later chosen as one of the 125 greatest hurlers of all-time in a 2009 poll. In retirement from playing Daly became involved in team management and coaching. After guiding Clarecastle, Kilmoyley and Kilmihil to club titles in their respective counties, he had an unsuccessful three-year spell as manager of the Clare senior team. During a six-year tenure as Dublin manager Daly guided the team to their first provincial and national successes in over fifty years.
