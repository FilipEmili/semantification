VThe 1988 Australian Touring Car Championship was a CAMS sanctioned motor racing title for drivers of Group 3A Touring Cars. It was the 29th running of the Australian Touring Car Championship. Promoted as the "1988 Shell Ultra Australian Touring Car Championship", it began on 6 March at Calder Park Raceway and ended on 17 July at Oran Park Raceway after nine rounds. The 1988 Australian Manufacturers' Championship was contested over the same nine round series. Amazingly the championship was shared between Ford, who won all races outright, BMW who won the 2001-3000cc class at every round, and Toyota who dominated the Up to 2000cc class.
