VDevin Marquese Bush (born July 3, 1973) is an American former college and professional football player who was a safety in the National Football League (NFL) for eight seasons during the 1990s and early 2000s. Bush played college football for Florida State University (FSU), where he was a member of FSU's 1993 national championship team. He was drafted by the Atlanta Falcons in the first round of the 1995 NFL Draft, and he also played professionally for the NFL's St. Louis Rams and Cleveland Browns. Bush was born in Miami, Florida. He attended Hialeah-Miami Lakes High School in Hialeah, Florida, where he was a standout high school football player for the Hialeah-Miami Lakes Trojans. Bush received an athletic scholarship to attend Florida State University, where he played for coach Bobby Bowden's Florida State Seminoles football team from 1992 to 1994. As a sophomore in 1993, Bush was a starting safety for the Seminoles' Bowl Coalition national championship team that defeated the Nebraska Cornhuskers 18\u201316 in the Orange Bowl. During his three-year college career as a Seminole, the team won three consecutive Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) championships, and Bush received All-ACC honors in 1993 and 1994. His defensive coordinator at Florida State, Mickey Andrews, later said Bush "was the most complete player he had ever coached." The Atlanta Falcons chose Bush in the first round, with the 26th overall pick, of the 1995 NFL Draft. Between 1995 and 2002, he played at both safety spots in his career for the Atlanta Falcons, St. Louis Rams and Cleveland Browns. He appeared in two Super Bowls: the Falcons' loss to the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXXIII at the end of the 1998\u201399 season, and the St. Louis Rams' 23\u201316 win over the Tennessee Titans Super Bowl XXXIV in 1999\u20132000. Bush had seven career interceptions, two of which he returned for touchdowns. In April 2013, he became a football coach at Charles W. Flanagan High School in Pembroke Pines, Florida. On February 18, 2016, Bush became a defensive analyst for the University of Michigan under head coach Jim Harbaugh, joining his son, who was part of Michigan's 2016 recruiting class, in Ann Arbor.
