VWilliam Lewis "Billy" Shaw (born December 15, 1938) is an American former college and professional football player. Drafted in 1961 by the American Football League's Buffalo Bills, Billy Shaw of Georgia Tech was the prototypical "pulling guard" who despite his size held his own against much bigger defensive linemen like Ernie Ladd, Earl Faison and Buck Buchanan. With the Bills, he won three straight Eastern Division titles and two American Football League championships in 1964 and 1965. Shaw was a first-team All-American Football League selection four times (1963 through 1966) and second team All-AFL in 1968 and 1969. He played in eight American Football League All-Star Games and was named to the All-Time All-AFL Team. He made the All-Decade All-pro football team of the 1960s. Shaw played his entire career in the American Football League, and retired after the 1969 AFL season. Shaw is the only player ever inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame without ever playing in the NFL (The Bills along with the rest of the AFL merged with the NFL the season following his retirement). He is also a member of the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame and the Bills' 50th Anniversary Team.
