VThe West End Library, now the Unionville Museum, is a historic library and museum building at 15 School Street in the Unionville village of Farmington, Connecticut. It is a single-story building, with load-bearing brick walls finished in stucco, and a red tile roof. Its main facade is seven bays wide, with a projecting gable-roofed entry portico in the center bay. The other bays have tall round-arch windows, with small rectangular transom-like windows set above, just below the roofline, with diamond grillwork. The Renaissance style building was designed by New York City architect Edward Tilton, and completed in 1917 with funding from Andrew Carnegie. In the 1960s library services moved from the building and in 1984 the building opened as a museum. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.
