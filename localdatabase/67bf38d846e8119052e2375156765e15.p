VThroat Sprockets is an erotic horror novel by Tim Lucas, published in 1994. It concerns an unnamed protagonist's obsessive quest to learn all he can about a mysterious film called Throat Sprockets. As fixation on the film consumes his personal life, he develops a sexual fetish for women's throats, an affinity which begins spreading to global and apocalyptic proportions, as the film's cult status and legend grows. Since its publication, Throat Sprockets has been singled out as one of the outstanding works of contemporary horror fiction by two important reference books, Dark Thoughts by Stanley Wiater and Horror: Another 100 Best Books edited by Stephen Jones and Kim Newman. In October 2006, Rue Morgue magazine included Throat Sprockets on their list of 50 essential alternative horror novels. Ellen Datlow selected it as the best first horror novel of 1994, describing Throat Sprockets as "an unnerving, sophisticated, and passionate novel. . . . Suspenseful and terrifying, with some beautiful writing."
