VDavid Allen Barr (born March 1, 1952) is a Canadian professional golfer who has played on the Canadian Tour, PGA Tour and Champions Tour. Barr was born in Kelowna, British Columbia. He attended Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Oklahoma and was a member of the golf team. He finished as runner-up in the 1972 Canadian Amateur Championship. Barr turned professional in 1974. From 1974 to 1978, he played on the Canadian Professional Golf Tour, where he earned 12 victories. He played on the PGA Tour from 1978 to 2002. He continued to support the Canadian circuit by playing several events per year, even after he joined the PGA Tour, although the Canadian events had much lower prize money. Barr had two wins on the PGA Tour. His first, which he calls the biggest thrill of his golf career, was at the 1981 Quad Cities Open. In 1987, Barr won the Georgia-Pacific Atlanta Golf Classic. His best finish in a major was T2 at the 1985 U.S. Open. After turning 50 in 2002, Barr began play on the Champions Tour. He became the first Canadian to win a Champions Tour event, the 2003 Royal Caribbean Golf Classic. Barr was inducted into the Canadian Golf Hall of Fame in 2000, and is also a member of the British Columbia Sports Hall of Fame. He lives in Westbank, British Columbia. Barr won the 2007 Canadian PGA Seniors' Championship at The Marshes Golf Club in Ottawa. He was also given a lifetime membership on the Canadian Tour.
