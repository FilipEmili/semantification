VTamarack Resort is a four-season mountain resort in the northwest United States, in the Long Valley of west central Idaho. It is located on the west shore of Cascade Reservoir, southwest of Donnelly in Valley County, about 90 miles (145 km) north of Boise. Opened for lift-served skiing in late 2004, the Resort went through foreclosure and emerged from it at a sheriff's sale on March 10, 2014. A court-appointed receiver, Douglas Wilson, closed the ski area in early March 2009, which was shuttered for the 2009\u201310 season. It re-opened in 2010 on December 20, with five of seven chairlifts, operated by the Tamarack Municipal Association (TMA). All major recreational and dining facilities have been restarted under TMA management, except the zip line tour which is operated by Experience Based Learning, Inc out of Rockford, IL, under the /dba/ Zip Tamarack. One of the three high-speed chairlifts was removed in 2012.
