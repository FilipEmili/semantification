VMount Washington Alpine Resort is an alpine skiing ski resort located on Mount Washington on the eastern edge of the Vancouver Island Ranges in British Columbia, Canada. The nearest communities are those in the Comox Valley, a 3\u20133.5 hour drive North from the capital of Victoria, British Columbia. The mountain allows for a wide variety of downhill terrain, ranging from beginner to expert. There are additionally facilities for snow tubing and two terrain parks. Mount Washington also manages 55 km of Nordic trails some of which are in nearby Strathcona Provincial Park. During the summer months the lifts are open to sightseers and downhill mountain bikers. Much of the summer activity is focused in the nearby park, which draws thousands of tourists and backpackers each year. On January 6, 2006, the mountain opened the Boomerang, a state-of-the art continuous lift system that extends up one vertical face of the mountain and down the other, with a capacity of 1200 guests per hour. The Boomerang lift opened up 400 acres (1.6 km2) of additional advanced terrain for the mountain. The Resort averages over 10 m of snowfall yearly, boasting one of the deepest snow packs in Canada.
