VHell Has Harbour Views is a 2001 novel written by Richard Beasley. The story is set in a corrupt Sydney law firm and follows the protagonist, Hugh Walker, a lawyer who always hoped he would be a defender of the poor and oppressed, until a Sydney law firm dangled an office with a harbour view in front of him. In no time he is turning a blind eye to suspect time sheets, representing powerful companies against powerless people, and not being entirely honest with his girlfriend. A 2005 ABC telemovie written and directed by Peter Duncan, was based on the novel.
