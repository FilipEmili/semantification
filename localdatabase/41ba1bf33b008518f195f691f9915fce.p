VBuilt in 1853 it is claimed that the light of Plumb Point Lighthouse has gone out only once since then, during the 1907 earthquake. The 70 feet (21 m) stone and cast iron tower with lantern and gallery shows a white light visible for about 40 km (25 mi) over the entrance of the eastern navigable channel and a red light over the south channel which is visible for 20 km (12 mi). The entire lighthouse is painted white and is in the historic Port Royal Protected Area, which the government hopes to develop as a tourist attraction. It is located about 8 km (5.0 mi) east of Port Royal and the entrance to Kingston Harbour. It is maintained by the Port Authority of Jamaica, an agency of the Ministry of Transport and Works.
