VAlport is a hamlet in the White Peak area of Derbyshire, England. It lies east of Youlgreave, at the confluence of the River Bradford and the River Lathkill. The oldest house in the hamlet is Monks Hall. There also used to be a pub, which was demolished thanks the construction of a main road, which leads to the A6 and towards Buxton. There are lead mines in the area, and at the Alport mine, an early steam-powered Nutating disc engine was installed.In chronostratigraphy, the British sub-stage of the Carboniferous period, the 'Alportian' derives its name from study of a core from a borehole drilled at Alport. The name "Alport" means "Old town", possibly with market trading connotations.
