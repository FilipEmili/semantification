VLiam Doyle is a Gaelic football player from with County Down, Northern Ireland. He plays for the Down senior football team and his local club Liatroim Fontenoys. Doyle was captain of the Down team that won the Ulster Minor Championship in 1999, and later that year won the All-Ireland Minor Football Championship. After nearly three years Doyle made a welcome comeback for the Down men in their 1-10 to 1-09 National Football League win over Donegal. Doyle scored 1-4 from centre back, winning man of the match and making Gaelic Life's "team of the week". Liam's father Willie Doyle was Center Half Back on the Down team that won the All-Ireland in 1968.
