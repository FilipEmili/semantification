VThe Former Chicago Historical Society Building is a historic landmark located at 632 N. Dearborn Street on the northwest corner of Dearborn and Ontario streets in downtown Chicago. Built in 1892, the granite-clad building is a prime example of Henry Ives Cobb's Romanesque Revival architecture; the pair of large winged Gothic gargoyles at the entrance were a more recent addition. The building was the home of the Chicago Historical Society after its original headquarters burned down in the Great Chicago Fire, and prior to its relocation to Lincoln Park in 1931. Afterwards, the building housed a magazine publisher, the Works Progress Administration, the Loyal Order of Moose, the Chicago Institute of Design (1946\u20131956), and recording studios (1950s and 1960s). Since 1985 it has been the location of a series of nightclubs.
