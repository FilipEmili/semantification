VMad River Mountain is a ski and snowboard resort in Valley Hi, Ohio, United States. The elevation of Mad River Mountain is 1,460 feet (450 m) with a vertical drop of 300 ft (91 m), and it has a ski season that runs from December 1 through March 16. The resort, which opened in 1962, as Valley Hi Ski Area, is owned and operated by Peak Resorts. There are 23 trails of various skill levels, a tubing park, three terrain parks, and two beginner areas. Of the resort's 12 total lifts, there are 6 surface lifts, 6 chair lifts, and 1 fixed quad lift. Since the annual natural snowfall averages only 36 inches (91 cm), Mad River Mountain has the largest snow making system in Ohio, with 130 snow cannons that cover 100% of the trails. The resort lies off U.S. Route 33 east of the city of Bellefontaine. It is located 6 miles (9.7 km) southeast of Campbell Hill, Ohio's highest point, and it is near the source of the Mad River. The resort's iconic bar venue called 'The Loft' caught fire on September 16, 2015, and is considered a total loss. Local firm Thomas & Marker Construction was chosen to prepare the resort for the 2015-2016 winter season. The site was demolished and temporary structures were erected October 2015.
