VNorth London Credit Union Limited is a not-for-profit member-owned financial co-operative, based in Enfield and operating in the north London boroughs of Enfield, Barnet, Haringey, Waltham Forest and southern Hertfordshire. The credit union manages assets in excess of £3 million. North London Enterprise Club Credit Union was formed in 1994, for members of the North London Enterprise Club. It became North London Chamber and Enterprise Credit Union in 1997, in association with North London Chamber of Commerce and North London Enterprise Credit Union in 2006, before adopting the current name in 2009. A member of the Association of British Credit Unions Limited, registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, North London Credit Union is authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and PRA. Ultimately, like the banks and building societies, members' savings are protected against business failure by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
