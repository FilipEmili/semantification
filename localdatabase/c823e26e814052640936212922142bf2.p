VLauren Turner (also Carpenter) is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera Neighbours. She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 16 February 1993. Sarah Vandenbergh was the first actress to portray Lauren. She decided to leave the serial when she was told that Lauren would not feature prominently in storylines anymore and departed on 2 March 1994. However, on 4 November 2012, it was announced Lauren would be returning to Neighbours. Kate Kendall took over the role and made her first appearance as Lauren on 7 February 2013. Lauren is the "vivacious" daughter of Lou Carpenter (Tom Oliver). Vandenbergh described her as being happy, headstrong and into horses. She also thought that just by looking at the character you knew she was a girl next door type. Lauren's major storylines during her first stint in the show saw her have an affair with Brad Willis (Scott Michaelson), join a religious cult and begin a casual relationship with Wayne Duncan (Jonathon Sammy-Lee). Upon her return in 2013, Lauren brought her family with her and Kendall stated that they would have secrets. The following year, Lauren and Brad's long-lost daughter Paige Smith (Olympia Valance) was introduced.
