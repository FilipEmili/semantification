VThe Canada-Ukraine Parliamentary Program (French: Programme Parlamentaire Canada-Ukraine, Ukrainian: \u041f\u0430\u0440\u043b\u044f\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0430 \u041a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0434\u0430-\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430) or CUPP is a parliamentary internship program for Ukrainian students, established by the Ukrainian Canadians in Canada. The Program provides an opportunity for Ukrainian students to learn about the principles of democratic government and parliamentary procedures in Canada. During the Program, Ukrainian students work and study in Parliament of Canada, as well as gain experience from which generations of Canadian, American and West European students have benefited. On the basis of academic excellence, knowledge of the English or French and Ukrainian languages, and an interest in the parliamentary system of government, undergraduate university students from Ukraine and Ukrainian diaspora can apply for a CUPP scholarship. It is hoped that CUPP will contribute to the education of future leaders of Ukraine. Since the first CUPP program over 400 students from Ukraine and 24 Canadian students have participated in the CUPP program.
