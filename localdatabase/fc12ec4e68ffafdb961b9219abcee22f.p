It is the 15th-highest of the 40 mountains in North Carolina over 6000 feet. The mountain is split by both Haywood and Jackson Counties in the western mountains of the state. It is located in the Plott Balsams mountain chain between the Great Smoky Mountains and the Great Balsam Mountains. The mountain's summit is located within the Blue Ridge Parkway National Park Service unit. The mountain is a popular destination with tourists and amateur hikers, as it is easily accessible from the parkway. A visitors' center is located near its summit and a hiking trail leads to its top.
