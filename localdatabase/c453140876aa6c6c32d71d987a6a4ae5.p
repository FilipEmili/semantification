VChiddingfold Forest is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in south west Surrey and West Sussex, England. It lies near Chiddingfold and Dunsfold. The Forestry Commission owns and/or manages some 830 hectares (2,100 acres) of woodland in the forest complex of which 543.9 hectares (1,344 acres) is designated SSSI. It is one of 15 SSSIs in the borough of Waverley. The site lies within the Low Weald natural area and Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). It is home to the rare Wood White butterfly, but the Pearl-bordered Fritillary was last recorded in 2007. Rare moths include: Argent & Sable, Common Fan-foot, White-line Snout, Waved Carpet and Drab Looper. Chiddingfold Forest is home to the Bechstein's Bat. Three maternity colonies have been identified, with at least 80 breeding females. Fir Tree Copse, which lies within the forest, is noted for rare moths, lichen and fungi. Smaller plants include Enchanter\u2019s Nightshade, Wood Speedwell, Lily of the Valley and Wild Daffodils.
