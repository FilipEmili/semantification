VDieppe is a two-part Canadian television mini-series that aired on CBC Television in 1993. It was based on the book Unauthorized Action: Mountbatten and the Dieppe Raid by Brian Loring Villa. The series chronicled the events that led up to the infamous World War II Dieppe Raid on August 19, 1942, which resulted in 3,367 Canadian troopers either being captured, wounded or killed. It was criticized for not being completely accurate, and overdramatizing the events that took place.
