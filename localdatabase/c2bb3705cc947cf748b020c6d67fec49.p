VRosebud Elementary School is a public elementary school located in Loganville, Georgia. It serves grades K-5 and is part of the Gwinnett County Public Schools district, one of the 15 largest public school systems in the country. As of the 2010-2011 school year, 1026 students were enrolled at RES. Rosebud Elementary School is named after its nominal predecessor, Rosebud School. RES was built across the street from the original Rosebud School, organized in 1903 and situated on property now known as 4198 Rosebud Road. The 1.5 acres (6,100 m2) of land for the school was donated by Henry Thomas. Lacking a deed at the time of Thomas' death, the Rosebud School trustees later purchased the land for $125 and were granted a deed in 1929.
