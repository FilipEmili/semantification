VPaul Kerrigan (born 16 December 1986) is an Irish Gaelic footballer who plays as a right wing-forward for the Cork senior team. He is the current captain of the team. Born in Cork, Kerrigan was introduced to Gaelic football by his father, Jimmy Kerrigan, an All-Ireland medallist with Cork. He enjoyed Corn Uí Mhuirí success at colleges level with Coláiste Chríost Rí while simultaneously enjoying championship successes at underage levels with the Nemo Rangers club. An All-Ireland runner-up with the Nemo Rangers senior team, Kerrigan has won three Munster medals and six championship medals. Kerrigan made his debut on the inter-county scene at the age of sixteen when he first linked up with the Cork minor team. Unsuccessful in this grade, he later won an All-Ireland medal with the under-21 team. Kerrigan made his senior debut during the 2008 championship. He went on to play a key role for Cork in attack during a successful era, and has won one All-Ireland medals, three Leinster medals and three National Football League medals. He has been an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion. As a member of the Munster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions, Kerrigan has yet to win a Railway Cup medal.
