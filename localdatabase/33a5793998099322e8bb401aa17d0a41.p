VThe RM class is the classification used by the New Zealand Railways Department (NZR) and its successors given to most railcars and railbuses that have operated on New Zealand's national rail network. As NZR and its successors has operated many diverse types of railcars, alternate names have been given to individual railcar classes. 'RM' stands for Rail Motor.
