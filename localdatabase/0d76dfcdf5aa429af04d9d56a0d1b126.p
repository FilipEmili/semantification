VRosny College is a senior secondary college, located in Rosny, Tasmania. Rosny College was founded in 1973 to provide opportunities for post-year 10 education in the Clarence Municipality and it still draws the large majority of its students from schools on the Eastern Shore of the Derwent River in Hobart. The geographical setting of the College, close to the river and to the commercial and business heart of the district, makes it ideally placed to take advantage of these assets in the educational opportunities it provides for its students. The College is held in high regard within its community, particularly the business community which provides great support for their vocational programs.The current principal of Rosny College is Ms Deb Day.
