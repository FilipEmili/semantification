VRoundhill Ski Area is a family owned and run ski area in Canterbury, New Zealand, near the town of Lake Tekapo, 1.5 hours from Timaru and 3 hours from both Christchurch & Queenstown. The main runs are accessed by a 1.2 kilometre long T-bar (T1) and a shorter T-bar (T2). 2010 saw the installation of a 1.5 km long rope tow (The Heritage Express) rising 630 metres (2,070 feet) to the Richmond Ridge to give the field 783 metres (2,569 feet) of vertical drop overall, the largest in New Zealand. This opened the field up to advanced skiers and boarders. The Heritage Express is reportedly the longest rope tow in the world. The ski area caters primarily to beginner and intermediate skiers with extensive use of two snow grooming machines. With the addition of The Heritage Express, a large ungroomed advanced only area has been created. The trails have a difficulty distribution of 35% adv, 45% int & 20% beg. The base area is at an elevation of 1,350 metres (4,430 feet) with the T-bars reaching 1,620 metres (5,310 feet), and the Heritage Express 2,133 metres (6,998 feet).
