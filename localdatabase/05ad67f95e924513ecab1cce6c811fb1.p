VJohn Rinka (born October 4, 1948) is an American former college basketball player best known for his high\u2013scoring offensive ability and accurate jump shot while at Kenyon College from 1966 to 1970. A 5 ft 9 in (1.75 m) shooting guard, Rinka is in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) top ten in all\u2013time scoring despite playing before the advent of the three\u2013point line and the shot clock. He once scored 69 points in a single game, which is tied for the 21st\u2013highest single game output in NCAA history; his 41.0 points per game average in 1969\u201370 as well as his 3,251 career points are also the eighth\u2013highest average and total, respectively, in NCAA history.
