VLake Lansing Park North is a public park in Haslett, Michigan covering about 410 acres (1.7 km2). The park entrance is located at 6260 East Lake Drive across from the Lake Lansing boat launch. There are several trails for hiking in the spring, summer and fall months, and cross country skiing in the winter. Park North was completed in 1986 as part of a rejuvenation project on the Lake Lansing area, starting when Lake Lansing Park South, a sister park across the lake consisting mainly of a beach and picnic grounds, was purchased by Ingham County in 1974. According to the Ingham County Parks Department, roughly 450,000 people visit the Lake Lansing parks a year, with over 90% coming from the Lansing metropolitan area.
