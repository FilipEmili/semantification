VSouth Carolina Western Railway Station, also known as the Seaboard Airline Railway Station, is a historic train station located at Darlington, Darlington County, South Carolina. It was built in 1911 by the South Carolina Western Railway, and is a rectangular, brick building with projecting rectangular bays at the center of two sides. The hipped roof features a bell-cast profile, red clay tile, wide bracketed eaves, and intersecting gables. Each gable conains a Palladian window. Lawrence Reese, an African-American master carpenter who had constructed many houses in Darlington, built the station. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.
