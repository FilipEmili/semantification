VThe Menands Bridge, officially known as the Troy-Menands Bridge, carries New York State Route 378 across the Hudson River in New York connecting Menands with Troy. A through truss span, it was built in 1933. The bridge once featured a pair of elevating towers, as the bridge was once built to accommodate tall ships. The lifting device was removed in 1966, but the towers remained until their removal in the summer of 2000. On August 14, 1998, confessed serial killer Gary Evans kicked out the side window of a police van while driving over the Menands Bridge, jumped out, and ran from police. When he was cornered, Evans jumped off the bridge to his death, plunging 65 ft (20 m) into the Hudson River. He had been arraigned the previous day on capital murder charges.
