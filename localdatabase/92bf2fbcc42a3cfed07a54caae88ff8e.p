VThe Libertine is an 1807 English novel by Charlotte Dacre, written under the pseudonym Rosa Matilda. This was her third novel, published in four parts and collected into a single volume. It follows similar themes to Zofloya around the impact of female desire and libertinism. The Libertine was highly criticized after its publication due to the excess of language, improbable plot and supposedly immoral message. The Libertine follows the journey of Gabrielle after her seduction by a libertine, and the repercussions of his infidelity and their marriage-less relationship.
