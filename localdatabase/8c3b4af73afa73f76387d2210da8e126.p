VWay Up High is a children's book by Hugo- and Nebula-award winning author, Roger Zelazny. It is one of two stories he wrote for children, the other being Here There Be Dragons, and one of three books without heroic protagonists. One thousand copies of each of the two books signed by Zelazny were published in 1992 with illustrations by Vaughn Bod\u0113. Zelazny wrote Here There Be Dragons and Way Up High for his children in 1968-69. He admired the work of underground comics artist Vaughn Bod\u0113 and commissioned him to illustrate the two books. The drawings were exhibited at the 1969 World Science Fiction Convention in St. Louis, but before the books could be published Bod\u0113 informed Zelazny that although Zelazny owned the pictures he did not have the reproduction rights. Christopher S. Kovacs in his literary biography of Zelazny explains the issue: \u201cZelazny saw the book as two of his tales illustrated by Bod\u0113, but Bod\u0113 viewed it as a showcase of his art illuminated by Zelazny\u2019s text.\u201d The publication of the books foundered when Zelazny and Bod\u0113 insisted on equal royalties. Bod\u0113 died in 1975 and his estate agreed to the publication of the books with Bod\u0113\u2019s illustrations in 1992.
