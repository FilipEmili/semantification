VRace Wong is an actress, singer and businesswoman. Born in Malaysia, raised in Singapore, she pursued her career in the entertainment industry in Hong Kong with her sister Rosanne Wong which won her various awards for her singing career as the cantopop group 2R, including Most Promising Newcomer and Most Popular Group Award in the Annual Top 10 Song of the Year Awards (2003), Metro Broadcasting Music awards (2004), TVB Top 10 Songs of the Year (2004) and Hong Kong Commercial Radio Music Awards\u2019 (2003). Race Wong became a spotlight when she was chosen to star alongside Stephen Chow in his famous annual San Miguel TV advertisement. Following that, she rose to fame for her leading role in a TVB youth series Hearts Of Fencing. Which jumpstarted both her singing and acting career. Race Wong hoped to focus her acting on roles beyond her youthful and sweet appearance. Her outstanding performance in her first leading role in movie Abnormal Beauty Abnormal Beauty won her a nomination for the Best New Actor in the 24th Annual Hong Kong Film Awards (2005) and the 42nd Golden Horse Film Awards\u2019 (2005) in Taiwan. Race Wong continued to experiment with different roles both on-screen and off-screen. In 2006, together with her sister Rosanne Wong, they took on groundbreaking leading roles in a musical adaption of The Smiling Proud Wanderer stage performance by the Hong Kong Dance Company (2006) where Rosanne famously shaved bald for the role. The musical enjoyed a success which brought them to perform in Shanghai the following year. Later in 2008, Race Wong\u2019s starring role as a pregnant new immigrant from China was a break away from her usual youthful image in the movie True Women For Sale which earned her a nomination for Best Supporting Actress in the 28th Hong Kong Film Awards (2009). Race is one of the very rare few Singaporeans to have been nominated in the Hong Kong Film Awards. In 2010, Race Wong decided to step out of the limelight for a break. She took on a Masters of Business course to further her education and graduated with a Masters of Business majoring in Marketing from the University of Newcastle (Australia) in 2013. Concurrently in 2011, she made an unexpected career change into finance, taking on the role of Marketing Manager at Maybank Kim Eng Securities (Hong Kong). She was licensed with the Securities and Futures Commission to conduct equities trading. The year she turned 30, Race Wong made a surprising move to relocate back to Singapore where her family is based. Together with her younger sister Rhonda Wong, she set up Anthill Realtors Pte. Ltd. in 2013 a real estate agency licensed with CEA. She then co-founded Ohmyhome Pte Ltd in 2015, a tech company focused on connecting buyers to sellers, landlords to tenants in real estate. When asked about her career move, Race said that she wanted to focus her attention on something that will provide more value to people, something on the opposite spectrum of her celebrity lifestyle. She speaks fluent Cantonese, Mandarin, and English.
