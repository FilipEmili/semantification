VThe Old Fire was a wildfire that started on October 25, 2003, near Old Waterman Canyon Road and California State Route 18 in the San Bernardino Mountains, in San Bernardino County, Southern California. The Old Fire was one of 15 wildfires throughout Southern California that month, which became known as the "2003 Firestorm" and the "Fire Siege of 2003.". This included the huge Cedar Fire, the second largest fire in California's history after the Santiago Canyon Fire of 1889.
