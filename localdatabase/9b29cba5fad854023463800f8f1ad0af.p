VThe Highlands School District is a small, suburban public school district covering Tarentum and Brackenridge boroughs, as well as Fawn and Harrison townships in Allegheny County, in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. Highlands School District encompasses approximately 22 square miles. According to 2000 federal census data, it serves a resident population of 21,974. In 2009 the per capita income was $17,481, while the median family income was $40,715. Per district officials, in school year 2005\u201306, the Highlands School District provided basic educational services to 2,879 pupils through the employment of 229 teachers, 150 full-time and part-time support personnel, and 24 administrators. Highlands School District received more than $2.7 million in state funding in school year 2005\u201306. In July 2011, the school board voted to rename the districts' elementary schools and to realign attendance zones accordingly. The goals were to equalize student distribution between primary centers, reduce bus time and save money. The district operates both Highlands High School (9\u201312) and Highlands Middle School (6\u20138) in Harrison Township; Grandview Upper Elementary School (3\u20135) in Tarentum (Report Card 2010 ); Fairmount Primary Center (K\u20132) in Brackenridge (Report Card 2010 ); and Fawn Primary Center (K\u20132) in Fawn Township (Report Card 2010 ).
