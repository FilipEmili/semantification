VFilmfail Awards rewards the biggest fails of Bollywood. It is constituted by a group of Mumbai-based stand-up comedians called Schitzengiggles and produced by Silly Media and Entertainment Pvt Ltd. The awards will also be pay-back of sorts for critics who have had to sit through \u201cmany atrocious films round the year as part of their job. The results are based on an audience poll. Axe Deodorant were the sponsors of the first Filmfail Awards to be held on February 28th at St. Andrews Auditorium. The show will be aired on television on Zee Cafe (India only) on March 15th 2013.
