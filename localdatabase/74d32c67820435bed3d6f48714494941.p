VThe Purdue Boilermakers football team represents Purdue University (also referred to as simply "Purdue") in the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of college football. Purdue plays its home games at Ross\u2013Ade Stadium on the campus of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. Gerad Parker is Purdue's currently the interim head coach. The Boilermakers compete in the Big Ten Conference as a member of the West Division. Purdue had most recently been a part of the Leaders Division of the Big Ten, but moved to the West Division in 2014 due to conference expansion. With a 598\u2013545\u201348 record at the conclusion of the 2015 season, Purdue has the 47th-most victories among NCAA FBS programs. Purdue was originally classified as a Major College school in the 1937 season until 1972. Purdue received Division I classification in 1973, becoming a Division I-A program from 1978 to 2006 and an FBS program from 2006 to the present. The Boilermakers have registered 64 winning seasons in their history, with 19 of those seasons resulting in eight victories or more, 10 seasons resulting in at least nine wins, and one season with ten victories or more. Of those successful campaigns, Purdue has produced five unbeaten seasons in its history, going 4\u20130 in 1891, 8\u20130 in 1892, 8\u20130 in 1929, 7\u20130\u20131 in 1932 and 9\u20130 in 1943. The Boilermakers have won a total of 12 conference championships in their history, including four Indiana Intercollegiate Athletic Association titles and eight Big Ten Conference titles.
