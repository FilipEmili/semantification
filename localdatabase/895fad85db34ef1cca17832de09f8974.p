VThe Boy is a musical comedy with a book by Fred Thompson and Percy Greenbank (based on Arthur Wing Pinero's 1885 play, The Magistrate), music by Lionel Monckton and Howard Talbot and lyrics by Greenbank and Adrian Ross. It opened at the Adelphi Theatre in London on 14 September 1917, directed by Robert Courtneidge, under the management of Alfred Butt, and ran for 801 performances \u2013 one of the longest runs of any musical theatre piece up to that time. The musical was later produced in Australia, starring Gladys Moncrieff. It was also adapted for Broadway as Good Morning, Judge in 1919, by the same creative team, at the Shubert Theatre, running for 140 performances and then touring successfully. Two songs by George Gershwin were added to the score, including "I am so Young," published as "I was so Young (You were so Young)." It starred George Hassell (as Mr. Meebles), Charles King (as Hughie), Mollie King (as Joy Chatterton) and Edward Martindel (as Col. Bagot). Although the piece was revived several times by amateur British groups in the 1930s, it has not been seen since then.
