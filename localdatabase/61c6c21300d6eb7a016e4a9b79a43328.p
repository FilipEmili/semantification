VSaltholmen Lighthouse is a lighthouse that is on a small island off Lillesand in Aust-Agder County, Norway. Saltholmen (lit. "Salty Islet") is named after the salt extraction industry once there, established by Hans Nielsen Hauge. The lighthouse was commissioned in 1882. The lighthouse is in concrete, and has a polygonal beacon with a spire in a corner. The shape of the tower is rarely seen in Norway and the lighthouse is largely preserved as it was built. The lighthouse is therefore protected under the law on cultural heritage. The lighthouse was closed in 1952 and the present lighthouse was set up.
