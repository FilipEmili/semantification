VSocialist Voice was a Canada-based web-based publication that described itself as "Marxist perspectives for the 21st century." It was produced by loose network of Marxists who circulate it at movement events in Canada. Most were formerly members of the Communist League, the sister organization to the U.S.'s Socialist Workers Party. Some support the reunified Fourth International. Its two editors were John Riddell, a former leader of the League for Socialist Action (Canada) and Communist League (Canada), and Roger Annis, aerospace worker and trade unionist. Its board of contributing editors also included socialists in the United States and England. It published weekly articles that are available by e-mail. In August, 2007, the publication began to appear in print form as well. By March 2011 however, the publication ceased its activity due to "Commitments to broader movements".
