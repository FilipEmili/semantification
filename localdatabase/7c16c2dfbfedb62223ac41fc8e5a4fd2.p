VAlberton School is a three-story brick school located in Alberton, Montana, United States which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on January 13, 1997. Constructed in 1919 at a cost of US$70,000, the school was built to replace a wooden structure that burned in 1916. From its construction until 1960 it was the only high school within 40 square miles (100 km2). It continues to serve as a school, and remains architecturally intact.
