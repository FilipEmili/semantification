VThe Tri-City Apollos were a professional American football team based in Midland, Michigan. The team began as the Macomb Arrows in the Midwest Football League, changing their name to the Pontiac Arrows and Michigan Arrows before joining the Continental Football League for its 1968 season. 1968 home games were played at University of Detroit Stadium until the final home game of the season, which was played in Midland. In January 1969 the Arrows announced a permanent move to Midland, as well as a name change to the Tri-City Apollos. The Apollos finished the 1969 CFL season with a 2-10 record. When the CFL ceased operations in 1970, so too did the Apollos. Garo Yepremian was the team's kicker during its season in Detroit.
