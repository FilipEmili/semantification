V"I'll Never Find Another You" is a UK No. 1 single by The Seekers. It was The Seekers' first UK-released single, and was the second-best selling single of 1965 in the UK. The song was also popular in the US, reaching peaks of No. 4 pop and No. 2 easy listening on the Billboard Hot 100 charts. The track was written and produced by Tom Springfield, who was also responsible for most of the band's subsequent hits. The tune received a 1967 US revival as a country music No. 1 by Sonny James. In 2006, it received yet another revival with a folk rock cover from guitarist Les Fradkin on his CD Jangleholic. In 2010, the song was performed at a benefit for the homeless youth organization Teen Feed by Death Cab for Cutie frontman Ben Gibbard and his wife, singer/actress Zooey Deschanel. The song was added to the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia's Sounds of Australia registry in 2011.
