VMohawk State Forest is the sixth oldest forest in the Connecticut state forest system. It is located in the southern Berkshires of Litchfield County, in the towns of Cornwall, Goshen, and Litchfield. Beginning in 1921, 2,900 acres (12 km2) of land was donated by the White Memorial Trust. Today, the park encompasses 3,703 acres (14.99 km2) and is also known as Mohawk State Forest/Mohawk Mountain State Park. The name only comes indirectly from the Mohawk Indians, who did not live in the area. It is said that the local tribes would light fires at the top of the mountain to warn neighboring communities further south of approaching Mohawks. The area is most popular in the winter for cross-country skiing, and skiers and snowboarders using the nearby Mohawk Mountain Ski Area. It is also popular in the fall for leaf-peeping and offers hiking and camping opportunities. It is one of the few forests in Connecticut where hunting is prohibited.
