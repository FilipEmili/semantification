Born in Edenderry, County Offaly, Foran first excelled at Gaelic football during his schooling at St. Mary's Knockbeg College. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of seventeen when he first linked up with the Offaly minor team. He made his senior debut during the 1949 championship. Foran immediately became a regular member of the starting fifteen and won one Leinster medal. As a member of the Leinster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions, Foran won one Railway Cup medal. At club level he was a three-time championship medallist with Edenderry. Throughout his career Foran made 24 championship appearances. He retired from inter-county football during the 1963-64 league. In retirement from playing Foran became involved in team management and coaching. He was a selector when Offaly won the All-Ireland title in 1982.
