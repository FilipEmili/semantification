VAirheart is a 1986 video game for the Apple II. It was designed and programmed by Dan Gorlin and published by Brøderbund. It requires an Apple IIe enhanced (or later) to run, as it uses double hi-res graphics. Airheart was a precursor to Gorlin's later game, Typhoon Thompson in Search for the Sea Child for 16-bit computers which is closer to what he originally envisioned for this game.
