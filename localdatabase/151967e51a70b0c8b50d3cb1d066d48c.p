VTrollgarden is a glacial moraine in the municipality of Hjelmeland in Rogaland county, Norway. The moraine is a 5-metre (16 ft) tall ridge of stones, rocks, and boulders that runs for about 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) from the east side of the lake Kvivatnet across the moorland to the northern side of the mountain Brendeknuten in the Hjelmelandsheiane mountains. The name "Trollgarden" is translated to English as The Troll's stone fence since it looks like a rock wall that a troll may have built around its farm. The ridge sits about 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) southeast of the village of Jøsenfjorden and about 25 kilometres (16 mi) northeast of the village of Hjelmelandsvågen.
