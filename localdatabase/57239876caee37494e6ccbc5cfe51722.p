VCanyons Resort was one of three alpine ski resorts located in Park City, Utah. Prior to 2015, there were 19 chairlifts, 4,000 acres (1,600 ha) of skiable terrain and an average of 355 inches (9,000 mm) of snow each winter, making Canyons the largest ski and snowboard resort in Utah. The base area is located 32 miles (51 km) from the Salt Lake City International Airport, accessed via Interstate 80, and is four miles (7 km) from Main Street in Park City, along State Route 224. In the summer of 2010, Canyons was significantly upgraded by Talisker Corporation in order to compete with the other nearby resorts. In 2013, Talisker and Vail Resorts signed a 50-year lease for Vail to run the resort operations. One year later Vail Resorts purchased neighboring Park City Mountain Resort and as of 2015, the two resorts are merged via an interconnect gondola and re-branded as Park City. The former Canyons base area is now called Canyons Village at Park City.
