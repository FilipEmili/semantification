VBlue Creek is a ghost town in Box Elder County, Utah, United States. It was a railroad settlement that started as a Union Pacific camp during the final stages of construction of the First Transcontinental Railroad. Located on the eastern slope of the North Promontory Mountains and Blue Creek Valley, 15 miles (24 km) southeast of Snowville and 20 miles (32 km) west of Tremonton on what is now I-84, Blue Creek existed from the late 1860s until it was abandoned in the 1900s. The settlement was named for the Blue Creek Spring, 2.5 miles (4.0 km) to the south. Initially a railroad camp, Blue Creek later became a farming community with a few scattered homes and a post office. In his autobiography, 19th century pioneer Alexander Toponce wrote, "In April and May of 1869, Corinne and Blue Creek were pretty lively places. At the latter place was a big construction camp generally known as Dead Fall and spoken of by some as Hell\u2019s Half Acre."
