VDuquesne City School District is a tiny, suburban public school district in the state of Pennsylvania. It is located in the east hills of Allegheny County, and serves the City of Duquesne (upwards of 7,000 residents), a former mill town on the banks of the Monongahela River. Duquesne City School District encompasses approximately 2 square miles. Per 2000 federal census data, it served a resident population of 7,352. According to 2010 federal census data, the resident population declined sharply to 5,566 people. The educational attainment levels for the Duquesne City School District population (25 years old and over) were 89.5% high school graduates and 9.2% college graduates. In 2009, per capita income was $12,067, while the median family income was $25,898. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the median family income was $49,501 and the United States median family income was $49,445, in 2010. By 2013, the median household income in the United States rose to $52,100. The District operates one school. In 2014, the District reports 366 pupils in grades kindergarten through 6th, with 100% of pupils receiving a federal free or reduced price meals due to family poverty. Additionally, 24.5% of the pupils receive special education services, while less than 0.5% are identified as gifted. According to a report by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, 100% of the teachers were rated highly qualified under No Child Left Behind. The school provides full day kindergarten. The school is a federally designated Title I school. District officials report that in school year 2005-2006, the Duquense City School District provided basic educational services to 913 pupils through the employment of 80 teachers, 60 full-time and part-time support personnel and 9 administrators. The student\u2013teacher ratio was reported as 11:1. The District provided basic educational services to 446 pupils. The District employed: 51 teachers, 42 full-time and part-time support personnel, and 5 administrators during the 2009-10 school year. Duquesne City School District received $11 million in state funding in the 2009-2010 school year. Beginning with the 2012-13 school year, students in grades 7 and 8 are given a tuition voucher to attend one of 2 neighboring school districts. The school is the student's choice. Duquesne City provides transportation. The tuition is paid by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. As of 2007, students who lived in Duquesne attend Duquesne City schools from grades K to 8. Students in grades 9 to 12 are given the choice to attend either the West Mifflin Area School District or the East Allegheny School District. This state-controlled initiative was a response to low standardized test scores, and a dearth of extra-curricular activities and sports programs at Duquesne City. The district's operations were run by the Allegheny Intermediate Unit. Duquesne City is one of four Pennsylvania school districts that does not operate a high school. Bryn Athyn School District, Midland Borough School District, and Saint Clair Area School District also do not operate a high school.
