VWindsor State Forest is a state-owned, public recreation area and forest preserve in the town of Windsor, Massachusetts, managed by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation. The forest is noted for the Windsor Jambs waterfall, which cascades through a 25-foot-wide (7.6 m) gorge between 80-foot-high (24 m) granite walls. Forest trails are available for hiking, mountain biking, horseback riding, and cross-country skiing. The forest's former camping and swimming areas have been closed.
