VPerry Bridge, also known as the Zig Zag Bridge, is a bridge over the River Tame in Perry Barr, Birmingham, England. Built in 1711, it is a Grade II listed building and a Scheduled monument. The bridge was built, in the 18th century, of red sandstone in a packhorse style. It is believed that it is the bridge built by order of the Staffordshire Quarter Sessions, held in 1709, to take the place of a 'wood horse bridge' (Perry Barr was in Staffordshire until 1928). It is said to have been built by Sir Henry Gough. A bridge has been on the spot since Roman times as this was the exact spot where Ryknild Street crossed the river, however, today the road is known as Aldridge Road. References to this crossing go as early as 1509 when there was a mention of a field, named Bridge Meadow, being located near Perry Bridge. The bridge is 50 metres (164 ft) in length and 4 metres (13 ft) wide. The parapets on each side rise nearly 1 metre (3 ft). It is now open only to pedestrian traffic. It features on the badge of Handsworth Grammar School. A replacement bridge, in Art Deco style, built in 1932, stands alongside, and carries vehicular traffic on the route.
