VCentre Township was a township that existed in Camden County, New Jersey, United States, from 1855 through 1926. Centre Township was incorporated as a township by an Act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 6, 1855, from portions of the now-defunct Union Township: "Beginning in the middle of Great Timber Creek at the mouth of the southerly branch of Little Timber Creek; thence along the middle of Little Timber Creek to a point where the old King\u2019s Highway crossed the same; thence northerly along the highway to the southwest corner of Cedar Grove Cemetery and corner of James H. Brick\u2019s land; thence along said line and by the lands of Aaron H. Hurley, crossing the Mt. Ephraim Road to the corner of the lands of John Brick, deceased; thence along the lands of Brick and John C. Champion and John R. Brick to Newton Creek, on the line of Newton Township; thence eastwardly by Newton Creek, on the line of Union and Newton, until it strikes the line of the townships of Union and Delaware; thence up the same to Burrough\u2019s Bridge; thence on the middle of the highway and on boundary line between the townships of Union and Gloucester to Clements Bridge, on the Great Timber Creek; thence down the middle of the said creek to the place of beginning." Over the years, portions of Centre Township were taken to create several new municipalities: \u000a* Haddon Heights on March 2, 1904 (also portions of Haddon Township) \u000a* Magnolia on April 14, 1915 (also portions of Clementon) \u000a* Barrington on March 27, 1917 \u000a* Tavistock on February 16, 1921 \u000a* Brooklawn on March 11, 1924 \u000a* Bellmawr on March 23, 1926 \u000a* Mount Ephraim on March 23, 1926 \u000a* Runnemede on March 23, 1926 \u000a* Lawnside on March 24, 1926 (also portions of Barrington) With the creation of Lawnside, Centre Township was officially dissolved.
