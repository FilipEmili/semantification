VBarns Ness Lighthouse is located 3.1 miles (5 km) from Dunbar and was constructed by the engineer David A. Stevenson between 1899 and 1901. Taking approximately 2½ years to construct, it was constructed from stone quarried from Craigree (near Cramond) and Barnton. It was illuminated in October 1901 The stone proved resilient during the Second World War, when the lighthouse was machine-gunned yet sustained no damage. The lighthouse was manned by two lighthouse-keepers until 1966 when it was electrified, with a backup generator and emergency battery (used if the generator failed). It remained semi-automated, requiring only a single keeper, until 1986, when it was completely automated. In early 2005, the UK and Ireland lighthouse authorities issued a consultation regarding a review of lighthouses, and it was decided that the Barns Ness Lighthouse was no longer needed. It was deactivated in October 2005.
