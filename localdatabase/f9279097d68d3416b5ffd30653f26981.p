VAndes Station, branch MP 8.45, was the busiest railroad station on the Delaware and Northern's Andes Branch, serving the bustling Village of Andes, and was also at the branch's northern terminus. It was fully erected, including minor details, in 1907, a year after the branch opened up. The station was abandoned when the Delaware & Northern abandoned the Andes branch in 1921, and was left to a poor fate. It is currently on the property of a lumber mill, and was being used as a tool house until it was purchased by the Town of Andes. It is currently being restored by the town. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.
