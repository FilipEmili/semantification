VThe Budd Silverliner was a model of Electric Multiple Unit railcar designed and built by the Budd Company with 59 examples being delivered starting in 1963. 55 of the cars were purchased for the Reading and Pennsylvania Railroads with public funds for use in Philadelphia, PA area commuter rail service with the remaining 4 cars being purchased by USDOT for use in high-speed rail experiments in 1965. Based on a series of 6 prototype Pioneer III cars built in 1958, the Silverliners represented the first production order of "modern" commuter MU equipment purchased by either railroad and earned their name from their unpainted stainless steel construction which contrasted with the painted carbon steel bodies of the pre-war MU fleets. The cars became a fixture of SEPTA Regional Rail service providing the name to their entire series of EMU railcars before finally being retired in 2012 after 49 years in service.
