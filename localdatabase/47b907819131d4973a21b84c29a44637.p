VFulton County Airport (IATA: FTY, ICAO: KFTY, FAA LID: FTY), also known as Charlie Brown Field, is a county owned, public use airport in Fulton County, Georgia, United States. It is located six nautical miles (7 mi, 11 km) west of the central business district of Atlanta. The airport's name comes from the nickname of former Atlanta politician Charles M. Brown, who served on the city council and county commission during the 1960s. It is also called Charlie Brown Airport or Brown Field. On the radio, however, it is referred to as "County Tower" or "County Ground". As per Federal Aviation Administration records, the airport had 293 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 198 enplanements in 2009, and 725 in 2010. It is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011\u20132015, which categorized it as a reliever airport. It is a local Class D airport located just west of Atlanta and the nearest airport to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (which is just south of Atlanta), and handles much of the general aviation traffic that would otherwise go there. The airport exists below and in close proximity to ATL's Class B airspace. It is located very near Interstate 20, Interstate 285, and the Chattahoochee River, just outside the Atlanta city limits. It reports ASOS weather conditions 24 hours per day as West Atlanta. It also acted as the nearest backup weather station when Dobbins Air Reserve Base did not report overnight.
