VKang Wook-soon (born 2 June 1966) is a South Korean professional golfer. Kang has played on the Asian Tour since it began in its modern form in 1995. He topped the Order of Merit in 1996 and 1998 and was the first man to reach career earnings of US$500,000 on the tour. In 2002 he was the top player on the Korean circuit. In 2003 he missed out on a PGA Tour card by one shot after three-putting the last hole of Final Qualifying to make bogie. He still qualified to play the Nationwide Tour in 2004, but despite recording a top ten finish in his third outing he left after six events because he couldn't live with the American food. He has seven career wins on the Asian Tour and several others elsewhere.
