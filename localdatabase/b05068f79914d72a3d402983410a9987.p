VThe term bogan (/\u02c8bo\u028a\u0261\u0259n/) is a derogatory Australian and New Zealand slang word used to describe a person whose speech, clothing, attitude and behaviour exemplify values and behaviour considered unrefined or unsophisticated, similar to the British term chav. Depending on the context, the term can be pejorative or self-deprecating. Over the course of the last several decades, the bogan has become a very widespread and well-recognised subculture, often as an example of bad taste. Various localised names exist that describe the same or very similar groups of people.
