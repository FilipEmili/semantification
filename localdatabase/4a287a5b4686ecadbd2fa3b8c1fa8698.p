VNow (styled as NOW), also known as Now Magazine, is a free alternative weekly newspaper in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was first printed on September 10, 1981 by Michael Hollett and Alice Klein. Now is an alternative weekly mixing arts and entertainment news with political coverage. Editorially, it strongly favours the New Democratic Party (NDP) politically. Independent and privately owned by Hollett and Klein, Now is published 52 times a year. The publication can be picked up in cafes, variety stores, clothing outlets, restaurants, alternative movie venues and in its green and red newspaper boxes. Now is published every Thursday. Now has been online since 1993, first as now.com and then as nowtoronto.com since 2000. The Now site hosts a video channel, NowTube, daily blog postings, and podcasts. In August 2009 Now launched its first smartphone application, a restaurant guide based on the publication\u2019s N rating system. Other applications are in development. The Toronto Star launched Eye Weekly in 1991 as a competitor to Now, although Now consistently remained the more widely read publication and Eye Weekly folded in 2011. It is also a central sponsor and its owners hold an ownership stake in North by Northeast, a major annual music festival in Toronto.
