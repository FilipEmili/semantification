VNortheast China (simplified Chinese: \u4e2d\u56fd\u4e1c\u5317; traditional Chinese: \u4e2d\u570b\u6771\u5317; pinyin: Zh\u014dngguó D\u014dngb\u011bi) or Dongbei is a geographical region of China. It also historically corresponds with the term Manchuria in the English language. It consists specifically of the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang, collectively referred as the Three Northeastern Provinces (\u4e1c\u5317\u4e09\u7701, D\u014dngb\u011bi s\u0101nsh\u011bng), but broadly also encompasses the eastern part of Inner Mongolia. The region is separated from Far Eastern Russia to the north largely by the Amur, Argun and Ussuri rivers, from North Korea to the south by the Yalu River and Tumen River, and from the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region to the west by the Greater Khingan Range. The heartland of the region is the Northeast China Plain.In the context of the Northeast Area Revitalization Plan by the State Council of the People's Republic of China, five prefecture-level cities of eastern Inner Mongolia, namely Xilin Gol, Chifeng, Tongliao, Hinggan and Hulunbuir, are also formally defined as regions of the Northeast. The region is nearly congruent with some definitions of "Manchuria" in historical foreign usage.Another term for the area is Guandong (\u5173\u4e1c / \u95dc\u6771, Gu\u0101nd\u014dng), meaning "east of the Pass", referring to the famous Shanhai Pass between Liaoning Province and the neighboring Hebei Province (and also North China) to the west. This name was also used by the occupying Japanese colonists referring to their leased territory of Dalian after the 1895 Treaty of Shimonoseki, as the Kwantung Chou (\u95a2\u6771\u5dde), which gave name to the occupying Kwantung Army that was later mobilized to set up the puppet state of Manchukuo.
