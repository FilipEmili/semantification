VJerome (/d\u0292\u0259\u02c8ro\u028am/; Latin: Eusebius Sophronius Hieronymus; Greek: \u0395\u1f50\u03c3\u03ad\u03b2\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a3\u03c9\u03c6\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f39\u03b5\u03c1\u03ce\u03bd\u03c5\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2; c.\u202f 347 \u2013 30 September 420) was a presbyter, confessor, theologian and historian. He was the son of Eusebius, born at Stridon, a village near Emona on the border of Dalmatia and Pannonia, then part of northeastern Italy. He is best known for his translation of most of the Bible into Latin (the translation that became known as the Vulgate), and his commentaries on the Gospels. His list of writings is extensive.The protégé of Pope Damasus I, who died in December of 384, Jerome was known for his teachings on Christian moral life, especially to those living in cosmopolitan centers such as Rome. In many cases, he focused his attention to the lives of women and identified how a woman devoted to Jesus should live her life. This focus stemmed from his close patron relationships with several prominent female ascetics who were members of affluent senatorial families.He is recognised as a Saint and Doctor of the Church by the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Lutheran Church, and the Anglican Communion. His feast day is 30 September.
