VPeter 'The Man in the Cap' McDermott (1 February 1918 \u2013 11 October 2011) was an inter-county Gaelic footballer for County Meath in Ireland who enjoyed much success in the 1940s and 1950s. During his playing career he won 2 Senior All Ireland medals (1949 & as captain in 1954) as well as 6 Leinster medals. He played in 4 All Ireland Finals.Peter McDermott had the unusual distinction of participation in five All-Ireland final matches in the four years between 1951 and 1954. He played in the 1951, 52 (draw and replay) and 54 finals and refereed the 1953 final. He is also the only man to referee an All-Ireland final both before and after winning one.In the sixties he was coach on the Meath team and held this position when Meath won the All-Ireland title in 1967.He is jointly credited with starting the International Compromise Rules Series. McDermott collaborated with Harry Beitzel of Australia to arrange a two-match tour by an Australian Rules side, which played (and defeated) reigning All-Ireland Champions Meath at Croke Park in October 1967 under Gaelic football rules. When the International series started formally in 1984 Peter was manager of the Irish Team.In recognition of his skills and long-running contribution to the sport, McDermott was awarded the 1989 All-Time All Star Award as no All Stars Awards were being issued at the time of his playing career.
