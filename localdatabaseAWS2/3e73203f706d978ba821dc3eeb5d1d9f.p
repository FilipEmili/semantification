VAl-Sadd Sports Club (Arabic: \u0646\u0627\u062f\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0633\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0636\u064a\u200e\u200e) is a Qatari sports club based in the Al Sadd district of the city of Doha. It is best known for its association football team, which competes in the top level of Qatari football, the Qatar Stars League. Locally, it is known primarily by the nickname "Al Zaeem", which translates to "The Boss". The club has participation in handball, basketball, volleyball, table tennis and athletics. It is the most successful sports club in the country, and holds a national record of 50 official football championships.The origin of Al Sadd's conception began with four Qatari students whom excelled in football, but did not wish to join any of the existing football clubs. After consulting with the minister of Youth and Sports, the group, led by Abdulla bin Ahmed bin Mubarak Al Ali and Ali bin Mohammad bin Ali bin Sultan Al Ali, founded the club on 21 October 1969 in Qatar's capital city.In the 1989 season, they became the first Arab club side to triumph in the Asian Club Championship by defeating Al Rasheed of Iraq on an aggregate of away goals. Twenty-three years later, they were once again victorious in the top regional competition, now known as the Asian Champions League, earning a spot in the FIFA Club World Cup. They finished third, becoming the first West Asian side to claim third place in the competition.
