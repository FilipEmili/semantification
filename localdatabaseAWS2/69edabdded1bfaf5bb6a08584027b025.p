VVettai (English: Hunt) is a 2012 Indian Tamil action film written and directed by N. Linguswamy. The film stars Arya, R. Madhavan, Sameera Reddy and Amala Paul in the lead roles while Ashutosh Rana, Thambi Ramaiah and Nassar played supporting roles. The film score is composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja, while cinematography is by Nirav Shah and editing handled by Anthony Gonsalves. The film became announced shortly after the release of Lingusamy's Paiyaa, with Dhayanidhi Alagiri's Cloud Nine Movies agreeing to produce the film, following a successful collaboration during the director's previous film. During a lengthy pre-production phase, the film underwent major changes in its main cast and Cloud Nine Movies stepped out of the project, with Linguswamy's own banner, Thirupathi Brothers, taking up the film. Filming was initially planned to begin by mid-2010, but was delayed until March 2011. The film was later remade into Telugu as Tadakha by Kishore Kumar and in Bengali as Hitman by Sumon.The film revolves around two brothers, the elder being sensitive to violence and the younger being a jobless rogue, settled in Thoothukudi. After the death of their father, a police officer, the elder brother takes on the same job by request of the younger. The older brother rises to fame in his job by having his younger brother secretly punish suspects and save victims for him. This angers two of the village's biggest mob bosses, who begin to seek revenge on the elder brother. After getting severely beaten by them, the elder brother loses his fear and becomes physically stronger through training from his younger brother. How the brothers get back at two gangs and protect their families form the rest of the story.
