VGrits, properly known as hominy grits, is a food made from corn that has been treated with an alkali in a process called nixtamalization, which is ground into a meal and then boiled. Grits are usually served with other flavorings as a breakfast dish, usually savory. It is popular in the Southern United States. It may also be found as an evening entrée when made with shrimp. Grits should not be confused with boiled ground corn maize which makes "hasty pudding" or "mush" or when using coarse ground corn, may be made into polenta.Grits is of Native American origin and is similar to other thick maize-based porridges from around the world such as polenta.The word "grits" may be treated as either singular or plural; historically, in the American South it was always singular. It derives from the Old English word "grytt," meaning coarse meal.
