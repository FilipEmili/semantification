VThe 1995 NFL season was the 76th regular season of the National Football League. The league expanded to 30 teams with the addition of the Carolina Panthers and the Jacksonville Jaguars. The two expansion teams were slotted into the two remaining divisions that had only four teams (while the other four had five teams): the AFC Central (Jaguars) and the NFC West (Panthers).Meanwhile, the two teams in Los Angeles relocated to other cities: the Rams transferred to St. Louis (but moved back in 2016) and the Raiders moved back to Oakland. During the course of the season it emerged that the Cleveland Browns would relocate to Baltimore for the 1996 season. The Raiders move was not announced until after the schedule had been announced, which resulted in a problem in the third week of the season when both the Raiders and the San Francisco 49ers had games scheduled to air on NBC which ended up overlapping each other (the Raiders game was scheduled for 10:00 AM PDT in case they were to move and NBC was given the doubleheader so that both Bay Area teams had their games televised locally).The season ended with Super Bowl XXX, when the Dallas Cowboys defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 27-17 at the Sun Devil Stadium. They became the first team in NFL history to win three Super Bowls in four years. This season was legendary Miami Dolphins head coach Don Shula's last season as coach.
