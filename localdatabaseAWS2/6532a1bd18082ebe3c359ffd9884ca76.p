VThe 1992 NFL season was the 73rd regular season of the National Football League.Due to the damage caused by Hurricane Andrew, the New England Patriots\u2013Miami Dolphins game that was scheduled for September 6 at Joe Robbie Stadium was rescheduled to October 18. Both teams originally had that weekend off. This marked the first time since the 1966 NFL season and the AFL seasons of 1966 and 1967 that there were byes in week 1; in those years, byes were necessary every week since there were an odd number of teams (this would happen again between 1999 and 2001).Atlanta opened the Georgia Dome.The season ended with Super Bowl XXVII when the Dallas Cowboys defeated the Buffalo Bills 52-17 at the Rose Bowl. This would be the third of the Bills four Super Bowl losses.
