VCzechoslovak State Railways (in Czech \u010ceskoslovenské státní dráhy, \u010cSD) was a state-owned railway company in Czechoslovakia.The company was created in 1918, after the end of First World War and the breakup of Austria-Hungary. It took over the rolling stock and infrastructure of the Imperial Austrian State Railways.In 1930 Czechoslovakia had 13,600 km of railroads (the fifth largest in Europe), of which 81% were state (\u010cSD)-owned, and the trend was to nationalize the remaining private railroads. Most of the infrastructure was concentrated in the industrial regions of the Czech lands. 87% of the railroads were single-track. 135,000 people were employed on the railroads (around 1% of the population).When Czechoslovakia broke up in 1939, the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia formed the "Bohemian-Moravian Railway" company (in Czech \u010ceskomoravské dráhy-\u010cMD, in German Böhmisch-Mährische Bahn-BMB) under the control of the Deutsche Reichsbahn (DR). In the Slovak State, the company "Slovak Railways" (in Slovak Slovenské \u017eeleznice-S\u017d) was formed. In 1945 the \u010cSD was re-established.After the dissolution of Czechoslovakia at the end of 1992, the company was divided into the state-owned \u010ceské dráhy (Czech Railways) and \u017deleznice Slovenskej republiky (Railways of the Slovak Republic). The fixed infrastructure was transferred to the successor countries according to location; the remainder was divided by 2:1 ratio.
