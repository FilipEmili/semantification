He was an All-American and national champion sprinter at Clemson University.He broke the NCAA collegiate record at the 2008 US Olympic Trials qualifiers; recording a time of 9.89 seconds.

In the final of the Olympic Trials, Padgett recorded a wind assisted time of 9.85 s but finished in fourth position. This meant he did not qualify for the Olympic event.

In their qualification heat they did not finish due to a mistake in the baton exchange and they were eliminated.At the beginning of the 2009 athletics season, he decided to turn professional, leaving the collegiate system.
