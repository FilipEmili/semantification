VThe O'Neill dynasty (Irish: Ó Néill) is a group of families, ultimately all of Irish Gaelic origin, that have held prominent positions and titles in Ireland and elsewhere. As Chiefs of Cenél nEógain, they are historically the most prominent family of the Northern Uí Néill, along with the O'Donnell and O'Doherty. The O'Neills hold that their ancestors were Kings of Ailech during the Early Middle Ages, as descendants of Niall of the Nine Hostages.A number of their progenitors and members are named as High Kings of Ireland, such as Niall Glúndub (from whom they take their name) and Domnall ua Néill. From 1185 until 1616, the O'Neills were sovereign Kings of Tír Eógain, holding territories in the north of Ireland; particularly around what is today County Tyrone. After their realm was merged with the Kingdom of Ireland and the land was caught up in the Plantation of Ulster, they were involved in a number of significant events, such as Tyrone's Rebellion, the Flight of the Earls, the Irish Rebellion of 1641 and the Irish Confederate Wars. The last name O'Neill means champion. In terms of conflicts with Viking/Norse settlements, the O'Neill dynasty crushed invasions on three separate occasions

The O'Neills hold that their ancestors were Kings of Ailech during the Early Middle Ages, as descendants of Niall of the Nine Hostages. A sept and family in relation to the O' Neill dynasty were the O'Higgins family, ancestral family to the Higgins relations , of Ballynary who controlled part of the Irish kingdom of Connacht until they were kicked out from their land by Oliver Cromwell and the English influence. Their founder was Shean Duff O'Higgins, married to a daughter of the royal family of O'Connor.He was seemed to be descended from the King Niall of Tara.A number of their progenitors and members are named as High Kings of Ireland, such as Niall Glúndub (from whom they take their name) and Domnall ua Néill.
