VThe Class 92 is a type of electric multiple unit operated by Keretapi Tanah Melayu on its KTM Komuter services. A total of 38 sets were built by CSR Zhuzhou of China, in 6-car formations. The first EMU has been delivered on the 23rd of September and was expected to operate in revenue service by late December 2011. However, delays in testing led to the subsequent postponement of launch. On 8 March 2012, 4 sets of KTM Class 92 commenced operation and all 38 sets of these KTM Class 92 were in revenue service by July 2012. The KTM Class 92 is the first train in Malaysia to feature a dynamic route map (passenger information system) built into the train. The EMU's complete interior and exterior design is designed by a German design office, Tricon Design AG. The class 92 will be using 65 million euros worth of Siemens made transformers, power converters, traction motors and vehicle control systems.The Class 92 was procured under a Malaysian Government initiative, National Key Result Area (NKRA) to reduce congestion and improve public transport with a specific RM2 billion allocation to KTMB to improve commuter rail efficiency. A sum of RM 1.894 billion was spent to procure these trains, with the remainder being spent on the improvement of signalling along the Putra-Mid Valley stretch and a ticketing system upgrade.
