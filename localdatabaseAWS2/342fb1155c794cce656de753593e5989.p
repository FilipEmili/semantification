VThe Nissan Cima (Japanese: \u65e5\u7523\u30fb\u30b7\u30fc\u30de Nissan Sh\u012bma) is a large full-size luxury sedan produced by Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. for the Japanese market. The car's name is derived from Spanish for "summit". The hood ornament uses an image of an acanthus leaf. The acanthus leaf was commonly used by classical Greeks to make a wreath for use as a crown.In Japan, the Cima has traditionally been Nissan's rival to the Toyota Crown Royal Saloon G and later Majesta. The Cima in the first two generations was a more luxurious and larger version of the Cedric and Gloria, with the Cima sharing the V8 engine from the earlier flagship Nissan President, Nissan's alternative to the Toyota Century. The Nissan Cima was introduced in 1988 and was based on an elongated Cedric/Gloria chassis. With its phenomenal sales\u2014about 64,000 units sold the first year and 120,000 in four years\u2014the car became a symbol of the "bubble economy".The Cedric Cima was sold at Nissan Motor Stores, while the Gloria Cima was sold at Nissan Prince Store. Later generations of the Cima shared the same platform as the President, with the Cima being a shorter version, thereby allowing Nissan to continue offering the Cima at Nissan Prince Store locations. The later iterations of the Cima were exported to the United States as the Infiniti Q45. The Q45 was discontinued after 2006, however the Cima and the President continued in production until August 2010, leaving the Nissan Fuga to become the lone flagship. April 2012, the Cima name was resurrected, and resumed "flagship" status in Japan as a longer wheelbase version of the Fuga.
