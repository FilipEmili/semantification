VSpring Fever (Chinese: \u6625\u98a8\u6c89\u9189\u7684\u591c\u665a; literally: "A Night Deeply Drunk on the Spring Breeze") is a 2009 Chinese film directed by Lou Ye. The production of the film is in defiance of a five-year ban on filmmaking imposed by China's State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television (SARFT) for his previous film, Summer Palace. Filmed in Nanjing, the film was described to be about a young threesome overcome with erotic longings.By the time of the film's premiere at the Cannes Festival on 13 May 2009, it was known that Lou had circumvented the five-year ban imposed upon him after Summer Palace by having Spring Fever registered as a Hong Kong/French co-production.
