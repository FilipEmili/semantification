VIoannina (Greek: \u0399\u03c9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1, Greek pronunciation: [io\u031e\u02c8\u0250.ni.n\u0250]), often called Yannena (\u0393\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b5\u03bd\u03b1, Greek pronunciation: [\u02c8\u029d\u0250.ne\u031e.n\u0250]) within Greece, is the capital and largest city of Epirus, an administrative region in north-western Greece, with a population of 112,486 (in 2011). It lies at an elevation of approximately 500 metres (1,640 feet) above sea level, on the western shore of lake Pamvotis (\u03a0\u03b1\u03bc\u03b2\u03ce\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2). It is located within the Ioannina municipality, and is the capital of Ioannina regional unit and the region of Epirus. Ioannina is located 450 km (280 mi) northwest of Athens, 290 kilometres (180 miles) southwest of Thessaloniki and 80 km (50 miles) east of the port of Igoumenitsa in the Ionian Sea.Founded by the Byzantine Emperor Justinian in the 6th century AD, Ioannina flourished following the Fourth Crusade, when many wealthy Byzantine families fled there in the early 13th century following the sack of Constantinople. It was part of the Despotate of Epirus from 1358 to 1416, before surrendering to the Ottomans in 1430. Between 1430 and 1868 the city was the administrative center of the Pashalik of Yanina. In the period between the 18th and 19th centuries, the city was a major center of the modern Greek Enlightenment. Ioannina joined Greece in 1913 following the Balkan Wars.The city has both a General and a University Hospital, and is the seat of the University of Ioannina (situated 5 km (3 mi) south of the city, with 17 departments and 20,000 students) as well as several departments of the \u03a4echnological Educational Institute of Epirus, the headquarters of which are located in Arta.The city's emblem consists of the portrait of the Byzantine Emperor Justinian crowned by a stylized depiction of the nearby ancient theater of Dodona.
