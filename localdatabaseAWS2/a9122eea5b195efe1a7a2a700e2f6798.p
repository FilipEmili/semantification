VNegril Lighthouse was built in 1894 1.5 miles (2.4 km) south south east of the westernmost tip of the island of Jamaica by the French company Bubbler & Bernard. It is one of the earliest concrete lighthouses.Its foundation is a tank 14 feet (4.3 m) deep, which is kept filled with water to keep the 20-metre (66 ft) (27 metres (89 ft) according to Rowlett) reinforced concrete tower balanced and secured in the event of an earthquake. The tower is topped with a lantern and gallery.An automatic white light 30 m (100 feet) above sea level flashes every two seconds. The light was operated by gas initially, switching to acetylene in 1956 and solar energy in 1985.Several adjacent one-story frame keeper's houses are staffed.The site is a well-known attraction of the Negril area.It is maintained by the Port Authority of Jamaica, an agency of the Ministry of Transport and Works.
