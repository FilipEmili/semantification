The surface of the island is 7.4 square kilometers and has a coastline of 21 km. The island had a small population until the period of the Second World War, and in recent decades has remained uninhabited.It is used by a few locals of Rhodes and Halki to spend a couple of days camping and fishing.. over time people have left supplies like grills, tables, chairs and some basic amenities. Just make sure you take your rubbish with you.I Jason and Liz have adopted this island as own (by heart not in paper) and look forward to every chance we get to visit for years to come.The island is mentioned by Pliny under the name Evlimnia name associated with two large bays of the island, Emporio and Saint George, in the eastern and western side of the island that are safe natural harbors . Their use in antiquity is confirmed by the impressive, carved into the rock, dockyards, dating to the Hellenistic period when it belonged to the Rhodian state.In the Hellenistic period, flourished when the Rhodian state, the island was fortified with the construction of the fortress and used as anchorage and observatory Rhodian fleet .the Hellenistic castle survived until today in the highest peak east of the island .Department of Hellenistic castle was used for the construction of medieval, castle, built in 1475, when Rhodes and islands occupied by the Knights .On the coast of Emporio found Roman tombs and visible ancient walls and the foundation of an early Christian basilica.The settlement of Alimia is built deep in the largest bay on the island. It includes several buildings, most of which are dilapidated due to the abandonment of the settlement from the 1940s. Although abandoned, the settlement has declared traditional since 1978. Northwest of the village, a short distance from the coast there is a small lake with salty water, which is one of the 37 natural wetlands in the Dodecanese.In Oktober 2016 a Belgian organization called 'Beyond Borders Belgium' will drop 20 people on this uninhabited island. The participants have to survive 11 days with hardly any food or equipment. Personal belongings like a cellphone, mattress or clean cloths are not allowed. Each day the participants have to play a game on the island to earn points. At the end of the "vacation" the participant with the most points wins the challenge. The game is based on a former Belgian TV-format called 'Expeditie Robinson'. The Greek government agreed with this concept and gave Beyond Borders Belgium exlusive rights of the island for the full period of 11 days.
