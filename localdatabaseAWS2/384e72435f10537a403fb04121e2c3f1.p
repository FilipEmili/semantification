VYukon (/\u02c8ju\u02d0k\u0252n/; French pronunciation: \u200b[jyk\u0254\u0303]; also commonly called the Yukon) is the westernmost and smallest of Canada's three federal territories (the other two are Northwest Territories and Nunavut). The territory is very sparsely populated with its about 35,000 people on almost half a million km2. Whitehorse is the territorial capital and Yukon's only city.The territory was split from the Northwest Territories in 1898 and was named the "Yukon Territory". The federal government's Yukon Act, which received royal assent on March 27, 2002, established "Yukon" as the territory's official name, though "Yukon Territory" is also still popular in usage and Canada Post continues to use the territory's internationally approved postal abbreviation of YT. Though officially bilingual (English and French), the Yukon Government also recognizes First Nations languages.At 5,959 m (19,551 ft), Yukon's Mount Logan, in Kluane National Park and Reserve, is the highest mountain in Canada and the second-highest on the North American continent (after Denali in the U.S. state of Alaska). Most of Yukon has a subarctic climate, characterized by long cold winters and brief warm summers. The Arctic Ocean coast has a tundra climate.Notable rivers include the Yukon River, after which the territory was named, as well as the Pelly, Stewart, Peel, White and Tatshenshini rivers.
