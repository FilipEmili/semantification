VThe \u0160koda 03 T (sold as \u0160koda Astra, later \u0160koda Anitra (Asynchronní nízkopodla\u017ení tramvaj; Asynchronous Low-floor Tram)) is a three-carbody-section low-floor tram developed by \u0160koda Transportation and Inekon Group. The design was introduced in 1996, and the first car was completed in 1998. The joint venture between \u0160koda and Inekon was dissolved in 2001, after which \u0160koda continued to sell the 03 T, while Inekon formed a new partnership with DPO (Dopravní podnik Ostrava, the city transport company of Ostrava), known as DPO Inekon, and in 2002 began selling a nearly identical version of the Astra, under the name Trio.The 03 T is uni-directional and has a low floor over half of its length. The front and rear sections, under which the wheels are placed, have a high floor; the middle section, between these, has a low floor.Some other \u0160koda trams, such as the 05 T and 10 T, are based on the Astra.
