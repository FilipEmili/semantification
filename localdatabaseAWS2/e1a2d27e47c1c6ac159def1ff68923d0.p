VLevi is a fell located in Finnish Lapland, and the largest ski resort in Finland. The resort is located in Kittilä municipality and is served by Kittilä Airport and Kolari railway station. At a latitude of 67.8° north, it is located approximately 170 km (110 mi) north of the Arctic Circle.The peak of the Levi fell is at an elevation of 531 metres (1,742 ft) above sea level. There are 43 ski slopes (17 of which are floodlit) and 27 ski lifts in Levi. Ascending the fell are 2 gondolas, 1 chairlift, 14 T-bar lifts, 5 stick lifts, 4 rope tows, and 1 magic carpet for children. Levi is one of two locations of gondola lifts in Finland, and has been chosen the best domestic skiing resort in Finland four times.Levi is an early stop on the FIS Alpine Ski World Cup circuit, hosting slaloms in mid-November; in 2012 the races were held November 9\u201311. The climate is somewhat too cold to host them in January\u2013February.The slopes in Levi are mostly suitable for beginners or intermediates, but there are also three black slopes for experts. The highest vertical drop is 325 m (1,066 ft) and the longest slope is 2.1 km (1.3 mi) in length. The longest ski lift is about 1,636 metres (1.017 mi) long. Levi has one superpipe, one halfpipe, two streets, two snow parks, 10 free children's slopes and seven slope restaurants.The skiing and snowboarding season in Levi is fairly long, often lasting from October to mid-May. The ski school provides instruction in downhill skiing, snowboarding, telemark skiing and cross-country skiing. Cross-country skiers have illuminated ski tracks and snow that lingers well into the spring. There are 230 km (140 mi) of cross-country skiing tracks and 886 km (550 mi) of snowmobiling tracks in Levi.The resort's location, north of the Arctic Circle, usually guarantees generous snow cover and sub-zero (<32F) temperatures throughout winter. It also allows for excellent chances of seeing the Northern Lights. Although very popular in winter, Levi is very quiet in the summertime yet still a good base location for exploring the surrounding areas.At 8 km (5 mi) from the centre of Levi is Luvattumaa, Levi Ice Hotel & Ice Gallery and at 45 km (28 mi) from Levi is the Snow Village Lainio; there it is possible to see snow and ice buildings, eat in an ice restaurant (in Lainio) or experience a night sleep in an ice room.
