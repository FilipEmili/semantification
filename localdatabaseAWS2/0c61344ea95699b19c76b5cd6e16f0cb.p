VThe Sheboygan Red Skins (or Redskins) were a professional basketball team based in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. They played for three different professional sports leagues, as well as an independent team. Their three league associations were chronologically the National Basketball League (NBL), National Basketball Association (NBA, charter member, one year of play), and the National Professional Basketball League (a single season organization).The team has origins from 1933 in informal clubs sponsored by local businesses. By 1938, they had joined the NBL, with a syndicate owning the team, and a new name, the Red Skins. They played in the NBL from 1938 to 1949, led the league in defense five times, appeared in five championship series and won the 1942\u201343 title, defeating the league-leading Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons (today's Detroit Pistons) in the finals.They were undone by the 1949 merger of the NBL into the NBA. The other league that merged into the NBA, the Basketball Association of America (BAA) had more money, played in larger cities, and generally fielded better teams. The Red Skins did not fit well, left the league, and joined the short-lived NPBL. When the NPBL folded, the team went back to its independent roots for one more year of play before it, too, disappeared.
