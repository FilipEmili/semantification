In 2014 she won a strong maiden race on her debut and then finished third in the Moyglare Stud Stakes before winning the Prix Marcel Boussac. She was rated the equal-best two-year-old filly to race in Europe in 2014. In 2015 she finished second in her first three starts (including the Irish 1000 Guineas and the Coronation Stakes) before winning the Royal Whip Stakes. She then finished second in the Irish Champion Stakes, ninth in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and second in the Champion Stakes. She ended her season by becoming the first three-year-old filly to win the Breeders' Cup Turf at Keeneland.
