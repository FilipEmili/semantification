VThe Harrisburg School District is a large, urban, public school district based in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The school district boundaries are coterminous with the city of Harrisburg. The Harrisburg City School District encompasses approximately 11 square miles (28 km2). According to 2000 federal census data, it served a resident population of 48,950. By 2010, the District's population increased to 49,550 people.Harrisburg public schools provide education for the city's youth, beginning with preschool through twelfth grade. According to District officials, in school year 2007-08 the Harrisburg City School District provided basic educational services to 8,391 pupils through the employment of 723 teachers, 209 full-time and part-time support personnel and 60 administrators. Enrollment steadily declined since 2005 due to a steady exodus from the city and a lower reproductive rate. A multi-year restructuring and reform plan was aimed at making the district a model, urban educational system.In July 2000, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court issued a ruling that upholds the Education Empowerment Act adopted by the Pennsylvania General Assembly, and signed by then Governor Tom Ridge, that permitted a change in the governance of the Harrisburg School District from an elected school board, to a board of control named by Harrisburg mayor Stephen R. Reed, and which gave the mayor direct oversight of the troubled district. It was the first time a mayor had taken on the role in the state.
