Sierra-at-Tahoe's terrain is 25 percent beginner, 50 percent Intermediate, and 25 percent advanced.The majority of the ski resorts in the Lake Tahoe region are on the northern end of the lake, near Truckee, California and Reno, Nevada. Sierra-at-Tahoe, Kirkwood and Heavenly are located on the southern side of the lake, approximately 75 miles (120 km) from Reno. It is common for visitors to ski amongst these three resorts when staying in southern Lake Tahoe area and not venture to the northern lake resorts such as Squaw Valley, Northstar at Tahoe, Sugar Bowl.Sierra-at-Tahoe Resort was started in 1946 by brothers Ray and Floyd Barrett as Sierra Ski Ranch, further down U.S. Route 50. It was sold to Vern Sprock in 1953. In 1968, the "Ranch" was moved to its present location when the California Department of Transportation began widening U.S. Route 50. The Sprock family operated the resort until 1993 when the resort was sold to Fibreboard Corporation. Fibreboard updated many areas of the resort, including changing the name to Sierra-at-Tahoe Resort. Booth Creek Ski Resorts purchased Sierra-at-Tahoe in 1996.
