VA ballet shoe, or ballet slipper, is a lightweight shoe designed specifically for ballet dancing. It may be made from soft leather, canvas, or satin, and has flexible, thin soles. Traditionally, women wear pink shoes and men wear white or black shoes. Tan colored slippers\u2014which are unobtrusive and thus give the appearance of dancing barefoot\u2014are worn in modern ballets and sometimes modern dancing by both men and women.Most ballet dancers wear soft ballet slippers for the main part of the ballet class. More advanced female dancers may change into point shoes for centre work and performance.Ballet shoes must fit very closely to the foot, for safety and to retain maximum flexibility.
