VCasuals United also known as UK Casuals United is a far-right British protest group. The group is closely affiliated with the English Defence League. The group describes itself as "Uniting the UK's Football Tribes against the Jihadists", and as "an alliance of British Football Casuals of various colours/races who have come together in order to create a massive, but peaceful protest group to force our Government to get their act in gear."Casuals United is organised around several British football teams' supporters. A leading organiser of Casuals United is Jeff Marsh of Barry, South Wales, a former member of the Soul Crew football hooligan firm. He has said: "Hooligans from rival clubs are uniting on this and it is like a ready-made army ... We are protesting against the preachers of hate who are actively encouraging young Muslims in this country to take part in a jihad against Britain."
