VIvan Go\u0161njak (Serbian Cyrillic: \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0413\u043e\u0448\u045a\u0430\u043a; 10 June 1909 \u2013 8 February 1980) was a Croatian communist who held numerous important offices in Yugoslavia during and after World War II, serving as the Minister of Defence from 1953 to 1967.Ivan Go\u0161njak was a carpenter by profession and joined the Communist Party of Yugoslavia in 1933. In 1935 Go\u0161njak was sent to Moscow and was enrolled for one year at the Lenin School where he also attended lectures by "comrade Walter", better known by his World War II-era codename Tito. In 1936 Go\u0161njak was sent to a military barracks in Ryazan where he was given the designation "Number 36", instead of his real name and was given military instruction before being sent as a volunteer to the Spanish Civil War in January 1937. A great admirer of Joseph Stalin, Go\u0161njak was appointed captain in the International Brigades. After the defeat of the republican forces in Spain, Go\u0161njak was detained in France in 1939. After the capitulation of France in 1940 Go\u0161njak escaped from the camp, going in 1941 to Germany as a worker. In Germany he used a fake passport, and in July 1942 returned to Croatia and immediately joined Tito's partisans.As a Spanish civil war veteran, he was given command of all Croatian partisan units in 1943. Go\u0161njak was appointed as deputy commander-in-chief at the end of the war, a post which he held until 1950.In 1946 Tito wanted to send him to complete his military studies at the Soviet Voroshilov Military Academy, but Go\u0161njak asked him for permission to stay in Belgrade and work in the Central Committee. Tito agreed and later appointed him as deputy Defence Minister (1950\u20131953). At the Fifth Yugoslav CP congress Go\u0161njak was elected a member of the Politburo and later was made a member of the Executive Committee (the new name for the Politburo), elected at the sixth (1952), seventh (1958), and eighth (1964) party congresses. In 1953 Go\u0161njak became Defence Minister, a post which he held until 1967 when he was replaced by General of the Army Nikola Ljubi\u010di\u0107. In 1963 he was considered for promotion in rank General, but he was never promoted.Stalin could never forgive Go\u0161njak for taking, as a former student of the Lenin School, Tito's side during the Informbiro period. At the Rajk Trial in Budapest (1949) General Go\u0161njak was accused "of having been a Gestapo agent from 1941 onward". But General Go\u0161njak and his comrade, General of the Army Kosta Na\u0111 (who was also accused of having been a Gestapo agent), "were from 1941 to 1945 commanders of strategic units of the People's Liberation Army of Yugoslavia, and toward the end of the war commanded corps that dealt the Germans heavy blows."General Ivan Go\u0161njak retired from active military service in 1974 and since then he was a member of the Council of Federation, and advisor body to President Tito. He is buried in the Alley of Distinguished Citizens in Belgrade, Serbia.
