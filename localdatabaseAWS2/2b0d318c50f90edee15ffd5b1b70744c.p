On 28 October 2015, the series was renewed for a second season and aired on Monday 21 March 2016.Contestants renovated two suburban houses, with one team eliminated each week. In season 1, the winner received a $100,000 cheque with half going to the winning couple\u2019s favourite charity and a new Mazda CX-5 and the runner up received $50,000 with half going to charity. Throughout the length of the competition, the contestants will stay in luxury style caravans provided by Elite Caravans.Each home will be judged by interior design experts who have been briefed by the home owners on the style they want for their renovation. In season two, the winning couple will again receive $100,000 but half will not go to charity.Each week, each home will be blind judged (unaware of which team renovated which one \u2013 or the rooms assigned to each individual couple) and the team with the lowest score that week will be eliminated from the competition.The show was cancelled due to unexpected low ratings during the second season which was less then half the viewers of the first season.
