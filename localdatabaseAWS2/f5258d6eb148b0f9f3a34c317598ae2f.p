VA martyr (Greek: \u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03c4\u03c5\u03c2, mártys, "witness"; stem \u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03c4\u03c5\u03c1-, mártyr-) is somebody who suffers persecution and death for advocating, renouncing, refusing to renounce, or refusing to advocate a belief or cause as demanded by an external party. This refusal to comply with the presented demands results in the punishment or execution of the martyr by the oppressor. Originally applied only to those who suffered for their religious beliefs, it is now often used for people imprisoned or executed for espousing a political cause.Most martyrs are considered holy or are respected by their followers, becoming symbols of exceptional leadership and heroism in the face of difficult circumstances. Martyrs play significant roles in religions. Similarly, martyrs have had notable effects in secular life, including specific figures such as Socrates, as well as in politics and Chinese culture.
