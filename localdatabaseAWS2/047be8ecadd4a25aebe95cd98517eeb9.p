VEbene City (formerly known simply as Ebene) is a suburb on the island nation of Mauritius, 15 km (nine miles) south of the capital, Port Louis. Construction began in November, 2001, with the city being promoted as a new information technology hub for Mauritius and as a link between African and Asian markets. As a result, it is also referred to as Ebene Cybercity or Cybercity.It is a cluster of modern skyscrapers from afar. Both an urban planning disaster and \u2013 for many proud Mauritians \u2013 the very definition of modern office life, Cybercity was first proposed by the government in 2001 as a high-tech hub, and now houses almost 25,000 mostly educated, middle-class workers during the week. While the development can be criticised for a shocking lack cohesiveness, poor public transport, limited parking or even difficult access by foot, its creation did bring many aspects of modern connected life to Mauritian workers.at the foot of the buildings, employees, who have travelled far from home, struggle to find parking spaces and walk on roads with no pavements to buy their lunch from hawkers
