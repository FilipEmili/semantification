VEilean Aigas (NH4641) (Scottish Gaelic: Eilean Àigeis, pronounced [elan\u02c8a\u0261\u030a\u02b2\u0259\u0283]) is an island in the River Beauly, Scotland, in Kiltarlity parish in traditional Inverness-shire, now Highland Region. It is most notable for the mansion on it at its north end, which was formerly owned by the Sobieski Stuarts and rented by author and Scottish nationalist Compton Mackenzie from Lord Fraser of Lovat. It is joined to the bank by a narrow white bridge.The Eilean Aigas estate was owned by the Lovat Frasers until 1995, when it was bought by King Chong Chai, a Malaysian businessman, for around £600,000. Chai put the island up for sale in 2001, for an asking price of £3 million. It was purchased by Brendan Clouston, a Canadian businessman, who was formerly president of Tele-Communications Inc.. The house was built in 2006, it is a replica of a 19th-century hunting lodge. In 2013 the estate was once again for sale, for offers over £15 million. It sold in 2015 for £3 million.
