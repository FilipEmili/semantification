VBoiler Room was a nu metal band who formed in 1996. The band, featuring vocalist Chris Lino, guitarist Rob Caggiano, bassist James Meselsohn, and drummer Mike Meselsohn toured through their local club scene for several years, building up their material and performance skills. The band broke through on local radio following an opening slot for Orgy in 1999. Original guitarist Joey Barracato played on their first self-titled 1996 CD and played the first couple years of gigs, opening for bands such as Type O Negative, Life of Agony, and Korn.The next year Boiler Room signed to Roadrunner Records, which was slated to release their debut album, "Can't Breathe", for the summer of 2000. The record, however, failed to come out after several delays, and Boiler Room signed with Tommy Boy Records. "Can't Breathe" was finally issued in November of the same year, only for Tommy Boy to drop the band once their short term contract expired. With no label, Boiler Room broke up in the summer of 2001, with only that single release to their credit. The song "Do It Again" did however appear on an MTV compilation disc titled Return Of The Rock that was released on June 13, 2000.DiscographyBoiler Room [1996] DIY Records01. Low Society02.
