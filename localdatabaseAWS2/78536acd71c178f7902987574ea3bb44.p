VThe Guardian is a British national daily newspaper, known until 1959 as the Manchester Guardian. Along with its sister papers The Observer and The Guardian Weekly, The Guardian is part of the Guardian Media Group, owned by The Scott Trust Limited. The Trust was created in 1936 "to secure the financial and editorial independence of The Guardian in perpetuity and to safeguard the journalistic freedom and liberal values of The Guardian free from commercial or political interference." The Scott Trust became a limited company in 2008, with a constitution to maintain the same protections for The Guardian. Profits are reinvested in journalism rather than to the benefit of an owner or shareholders.The Guardian is edited by Katharine Viner, who succeeded Alan Rusbridger in 2015. The newspaper has a UK online edition as well as two international web sites, Guardian Australia and Guardian US. As of August 2013, The Guardian's print edition had an average daily circulation of 189,000 copies, behind The Daily Telegraph and The Times, and ahead of The Independent. The newspaper's online edition was the fifth most widely read in the world as of October 2014, with over 42.6 million readers. In the UK, its combined print and online editions reach nearly 9 million readers.Notable scoops include the 2011 News International phone hacking scandal, in particular the hacking of murdered teenager Milly Dowler's phone. The investigation led to the closure of one of the highest circulation newspapers in the world, the News of the World. The newspaper also released news of the secret collection of Verizon telephone records held by Barack Obama's administration in June 2013, and subsequently revealed the existence of the PRISM surveillance program after it was leaked to the paper by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.The Guardian was named Newspaper of the Year in the 2014 British Press Awards for reporting on government surveillance. The Guardian is influential in the design and publishing arena, sponsoring many awards in these areas.
