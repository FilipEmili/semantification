He announced his retirement from inter-county hurling on 21 February 2002.His uncles, Haulie and John Daly, also played hurling with Clare.Daly is widely regarded as one of Clare's all-time greatest and most popular players. During his playing days he won three All-Star awards, while he was later chosen as one of the 125 greatest hurlers of all-time in a 2009 poll.In retirement from playing Daly became involved in team management and coaching.
