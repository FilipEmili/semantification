VThe Grand Trunk Steamship Prince George, and her sister ship the SS Prince Rupert, served the coast of British Columbia and Alaska. Originally these vessels served regular runs from Seattle to Victoria, Vancouver, Prince Rupert and Stewart (all, except Seattle, being in British Columbia), Seattle and Victoria were dropped from the route after a few years and Skagway, Alaska, was added. Prince George served briefly as a Royal Canadian Navy hospital ship in 1914. From 1925, ownership of both Princes was transferred along with the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway system to the Government of Canada to be operated as part of the Canadian National Railway. In 1910 Prince Rupert was beginning to develop into a city. Both the Prince ships were built in 1909. Prince George was completed three months later. By 1910 both ships began service on the coast of British Columbia.In 1945 Prince George was lost after she caught fire and destroyed in Ketchikan, Alaska. Her sister ship survived and stayed in service till her retirement in 1956. After the loss of Prince George, CN put a contract for a second (new) Prince George. This ship was launched October 6, 1947, and placed in service on the Alaska route in June 1948.

VThe Grand Trunk Steamship Prince George, and sister ship SS Prince Rupert, provided passenger service along the coasts of British Columbia and Alaska. In service from 1910 until 1945, the vessel saw brief service as a hospital ship for the Royal Canadian Navy during World War I. In 1945 the ship caught fire in the harbour of Ketchikan, Alaska. The burned hulk was beached on Gravina Island where it remained for the next few years until it was towed to Seattle, Washington and broken up for scrap.
