He began focusing all of his free time on becoming a producer. In 2007, DJ Frank E submitted a track via PMP Worldwide, and was discovered by Mike Caren of Artist Publishing Group and Atlantic Records, who signed him in early 2008.Since 2008, Frank E has produced songs for Madonna, CROSS GENE, Flo Rida, The Black Eyed Peas, T-Pain, Chris Brown, Travie McCoy, Enrique Iglesias, Lupe Fiasco, Sean Kingston, Toni Braxton, B.o.B, Three 6 Mafia, Nelly Furtado, Pitbull, Justin Bieber, Jason Derulo, Hayley Williams, Eminem, Cody Simpson, Wiz Khalifa, and many others.
