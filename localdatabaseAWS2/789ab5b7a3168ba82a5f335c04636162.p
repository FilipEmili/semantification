VThe Ford 335 engine family was a group of small-block V8 engines built by the Ford Motor Company between 1969 (for the 1970 model year) and 1982. The significance of the numerals '335' designated to this series of Ford V8 engines came from Ford management who dictated 335 cu in be the original capacity with room for expansion during its development. This engine family began production in late 1969 with a 351 cu in (5.8 L) engine, commonly called the 351C. It later expanded to include a 400 cu in (6.6 L) engine which used a taller version of the engine block, commonly referred to as a tall deck engine block, a 351 cu in (5.8 L) tall deck variant, called the 351M and a 302 cu in (4.9 L) engine which was exclusive to Australia.The 351C, introduced in 1969 for 1970 model year, is commonly referred to as the 351Cleveland after the Cleveland Engine plant in which most of these engines were manufactured. This plant complex in Brookpark, Ohio, included a gray iron foundry (casting plant), a stamping plant, and an engine assembly plant. As newer automobile engines began incorporating aluminum blocks, Ford eventually closed the casting plant in May 2012. The 335 series engines were used in mid-sized and full-sized cars, as well as light trucks, (351M/400 only) at times concurrently with the larger member of the Windsor small-block family, the 351 Windsorin cars. These engines were also used as a replacement for the FE V8 family in both the car and truck lines. The 335 series V8 engines, only outliving the FE by a half-decade, were eventually abandoned in favor of the more compact Windsor V8 engines. Due mainly to the fact of more stringent emission controls, there was also dying consumer demand for engines in the 400 CID realm, with mopar and GM discontinueing theirs after 79. The 351M/lasted untill 1982 in the F Series trucks, before being replaced by the 351 windsor engine. The 400 was also dropped in 82 being unofficially replaced in 83 by the Navistar (International Harvester) 6.9L diesel, which was billed to fill the gap between the 351W and the 460.
