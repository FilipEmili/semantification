VThe FM H-10-44 was a yard switcher produced by Fairbanks-Morse from August, 1944\u2013March, 1950. The units featured a 1,000-horsepower (750 kW), six-cylinder opposed piston engine prime mover, and were configured in a B-B wheel arrangement mounted atop a pair of two-axle AAR Type-A switcher trucks, with all axles powered. Many H-10-44s received modifications that increased their horsepower rating to 1,200 hp (890 kW).The Raymond Loewy-designed carbody featured a slanted nose, sloping hood lines, and (considered to be its most distinguishing feature) a protruding roof visor mounted on the rear of the cab. These styling cues were carried through to the H-10-44's successor, the FM H-12-44, until September 1952 when the exterior design was "Spartanized" to reduce production costs.A total of 195 units were built for American railroads. Three intact examples of the H-10-44 are known to survive today, all of which are owned by railroad museums. Most notable of these is Milwaukee Road #760 (originally delivered as #1802), the first Fairbanks\u2013Morse locomotive constructed in their own plant, which is preserved and on display at the Illinois Railway Museum.Another example is former Hallet Dock Company HD-11, which is now at the Lake Superior Railroad Museum in Duluth, Minnesota.A reproduction H-10-44 locomotive sits atop the Beloit Fishing Bridge, a former railroad bridge which crosses the Rock River several hundred yards south of the foundry where the H-10-44s were built, in Beloit, Wisconsin.
