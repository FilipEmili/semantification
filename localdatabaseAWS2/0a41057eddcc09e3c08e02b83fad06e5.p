VAn anchorite or anchoret (female: anchoress; adj. anchoritic; from Ancient Greek: \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2, anach\u014dr\u0113t\u1e17s, "one who has retired from the world", from the verb \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u03ad\u03c9, anach\u014dré\u014d, signifying "to withdraw", "to retire") is someone who, for religious reasons, withdraws from secular society so as to be able to lead an intensely prayer-oriented, ascetic, and\u2014circumstances permitting\u2014Eucharist-focused life. Whilst anchorites are frequently considered to be a type of religious hermit, unlike hermits they were required to take a vow of stability of place, opting instead for permanent enclosure in cells often attached to churches. Also unlike hermits, anchorites were subject to a religious rite of consecration that closely resembled the funeral rite, following which\u2014theoretically, at least\u2014they would be considered dead to the world, a type of living saint. Anchorites had a certain autonomy, as they did not answer to any ecclesiastical authority other than the bishop.The anchoritic life is one of the earliest forms of Christian monastic living. In the Roman Catholic Church today it is one of the "Other Forms of Consecrated Life" and governed by the same norms as the consecrated eremitic life. From the twelfth to the sixteenth century, female anchorites consistently outnumbered their male equivalents, sometimes by as many as four to one (in the thirteenth century), dropping eventually to two to one (in the fifteenth century). However, there is also a high number of anchorites whose sex is not recorded for these periods.
