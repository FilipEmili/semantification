VUntil the end of the Ethiopian monarchy in 1974, there were two categories of nobility in Ethiopia. The Mesafint (Ge'ez: \u1218\u1233\u134d\u1295\u1275 mas\u0101fint, modern mes\u0101fint, singular Ge'ez: \u1218\u1235\u134d\u1295 masfin, modern mesfin, "prince"), the hereditary nobility, formed the upper echelon of the ruling class. The Mekwanint (Ge'ez: \u1218\u12b3\u1295\u1295\u1275mäk\u02b7anin, modern mäk\u02b7enin singular Ge'ez: \u1218\u12b3\u1295\u1295\u1275 mäk\u02b7anin, modern mäk\u02b7enin or Amharic: \u1218\u12ae\u1295\u1295? mekonnen, "governor") were the appointed nobles, often of humble birth, who formed the bulk of the nobility. Until the 20th century, the most powerful people at court were generally members of the Mekwanint appointed by the monarch, while regionally, the Mesafint enjoyed greater influence and power. Emperor Haile Selassie greatly curtailed the power of the Mesafint to the benefit of the Mekwanint, who by then were essentially coterminous with the Ethiopian government.The Mekwanint were officials who had been granted specific offices in the government or court. Higher ranks from the title of Ras through to Balambaras were also bestowed upon members of the Mekwanint. A member of the Mesafint, however, would traditionally be given precedence over a member of the Mekwanint of the same rank. For example, Ras Mengesha Yohannes, son of Emperor Yohannes IV and thus a member of the Mesafint, would have outranked Ras Alula Engida, who was of humble birth and therefore a member of the Mekwanint, even though their ranks were equal.There were also parallel rules of precedence, primarily seniority based on age, on offices held, and on when they each obtained their titles, which made the rules for precedence rather complex. Combined with the ambiguous position of titled heirs of members of the Mekwanint, Emperor Haile Selassie, as part of his program of modernising reforms, and in line with his aims of centralising power away from the Mesafint replaced the traditional system of precedence with a simplified, Western-inspired system that gave precedence by rank, and then by seniority based when the title had been assumed \u2013 irrespective of how the title was acquired.
