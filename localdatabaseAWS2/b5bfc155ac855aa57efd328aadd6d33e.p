VThe Better Show was a syndicated lifestyle and celebrity focused daytime talk show. It aired weekdays on 160 stations across the United States. The program was produced and distributed by Meredith Corporation. The Better Show got its name from and is based on Meredith's flagship publication, Better Homes and Gardens. The show also tapped its other magazine's expert's in home, shelter and parenting.This was not Better Homes and Gardens' first foray into television; in the 1990s, the magazine presented a similar syndicated weekly series, Better Your Home with Better Homes and Gardens. In addition, the Australian version of the magazine has their TV series as well.The hour-long daytime strip show Better allows eight minutes of local content. While in Kansas City, the national version on KSMO-TV was also compliment by a total localized version, Better Kansas City, on KCTV. At least with Meredith stations those with some localized content gave a local version of the name. For example, WNEM-TV's version was called Better Mid-Michigan. while WGCL-TV's edition was known as Better Mornings Atlanta; and KPHO-TV's show was called Better Arizona. WPHL-TV (a Tribune-owned Better affiliate) aired the national version in the morning with local cut-ins throughout the hour, branded as Better Philly.
