VThe 2002 FIFA World Cup was the 17th staging of the FIFA World Cup which took place from 31 May to 30 June 2002 in South Korea and Japan. It was the first World Cup to be held in Asia, the first to be held on a continent other than Europe or the Americas, the last World Cup during which the golden goal rule was in force and the only World Cup to be jointly hosted by more than one nation as FIFA amended its statutes in 2004 to officially forbid co-hosting bids. Brazil won the tournament for a record fifth time, winning the final against Germany 2\u20130. The victory meant Brazil qualified for the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup for the fifth time, representing the World. In the third place play-off match against South Korea, Turkey won 3\u20132 taking third place in their only second ever FIFA World Cup finals. China PR, Ecuador, Senegal and Slovenia made their first appearances at the finals with Turkey making its first appearance since 1954.The tournament had several upsets and surprise results which included the defending champions France being eliminated in the group stage after earning a single point and second favourites Argentina also being eliminated in the group stage. Additionally, Turkey surprisingly took third place and South Korea managed to reach the semi-finals, beating Spain, Italy and Portugal en route. Another big shock came in the opening match of the tournament when underdog debutantes Senegal defeated defending champions France, going on to reach the quarter-finals only to be beaten by Turkey. However, the most potent team at the tournament, Brazil, prevailed and they became the first ever nation to win five World Cups.

Additionally, Turkey surprisingly took third place and South Korea managed to reach the semi-finals, beating Spain, Italy and Portugal en route, as well as the United States reaching the semi-finals, after beating Mexico 2-0 in the Round of 16, what proved to be America's turning point, getting them higher than Mexico by FIFA. Another big shock came in the opening match of the tournament when underdog debutantes Senegal defeated defending champions France, going on to reach the quarter-finals only to be beaten by Turkey.
