VThe Jersey Shore is the coastal region of the state of New Jersey. Geographically, the term encompasses about 141 miles (227 km)  of oceanfront from Sandy Hook in the north to Cape May Point in the south. The Jersey Shore area includes Middlesex County, Monmouth County, Atlantic County, Cape May County, and Ocean County. While there is no defined border between North Jersey and South Jersey, the Raritan River, Manasquan River or Interstate 195 are often mentioned as the border, with most of the shore region being located in South Jersey.To many New Jersey residents, it is simply referred to as "The Shore." A commonly said phrase within New Jersey is to go "down the shore", or to have done something "down the shore".Famous for its many boardwalks with arcades, water parks, and amusement parks boasting hundreds of rides and attractions, the Jersey Shore is a popular vacation spot for New Jerseyans, New Yorkers, and Pennsylvanians, and various other states in the Northeastern United States. Certain communities are also popular with visitors from the nearby Canadian provinces of Quebec and Ontario.
