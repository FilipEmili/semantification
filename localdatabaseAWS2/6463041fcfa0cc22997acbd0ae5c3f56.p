VPreston Smith Brooks (August 5, 1819 \u2013 January 27, 1857) was an American politician and Member of the US House of Representative from South Carolina, serving from 1853 until his resignation in July 1856 and again from August 1856 until his death.Brooks was a fervent advocate of slavery and states' rights. He is primarily remembered for his May 22, 1856 violent assault upon abolitionist Senator Charles Sumner (Free Soil-Massachusetts), with a cane on the floor of the United States Senate. This was in retaliation for an anti-slavery speech by Sumner in which Sumner verbally attacked Brooks' second cousin, Senator Andrew Butler. Brooks' action was applauded by many Southerners and abhorred in the North. An attempt to oust him from the House of Representatives failed, and he received only token punishment in his criminal trial. He resigned his seat in July 1856 to give his constituents the opportunity to ratify his conduct in a special election, which they did by electing him in August to fill the vacancy created by his resignation. He was reelected to a full term in November 1856 but died five weeks before the term began in March 1857.Sumner was seriously injured and unable to take his seat in the Senate for three years, though eventually he recovered and resumed his Senate career.Brooks' act and the polarizing national reaction to it are frequently cited as a major factor in the rising tensions leading up to the American Civil War.
