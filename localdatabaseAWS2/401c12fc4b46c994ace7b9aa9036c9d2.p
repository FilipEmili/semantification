VNorwin High School is located in North Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, with a current enrollment of 1748 students in grades 9-12. It enrolls students from North Huntingdon Township, Irwin, and North Irwin. It is part of the Norwin School District. In 1914, the Township of North Huntingdon, and the borough of Irwin and North Irwin signed a Jointure, combining the three schools. The original high school (now Queen of Angels Catholic School) was built in 1916, and was named Norwin Union High School. An Annex was added to the building in 1937, which survives today. The west wing of the building burned in 1944, and severed the jointure between North Huntingdon, Irwin and North Irwin Schools. The remaining annex was turned into North Huntingdon High School. In 1950, a new West Wing was built, and in 1958 the Jointure between Irwin, North Irwin, and North Huntingdon was reinstated. By 1964, the new high school building was being out grown by its students, so the school board approved the purchase of the McMahon Farm. The current high school was built in 1965. The current building underwent a massive renovation which was completed in 2006. Norwin High School's current Principal is Mr. Michael Choby. The Assistant Principals are Timothy P. McCabe and Joseph V. Shigle III.
