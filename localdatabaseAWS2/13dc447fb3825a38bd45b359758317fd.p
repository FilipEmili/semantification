VSelkirk Rugby Football Club are a rugby union side based in Selkirk in the Borders, Scotland.They play in their home games at Philiphaugh, and are now in the BT Premiership (1st tier of club rugby) and the Border League (the oldest established rugby union league in the world).The club was officially instituted in 1907, but the game of rugby was played in the Royal and Ancient Burgh of Selkirk long before this date. In 1877 a game described as the first to be played under rules took place at Philiphaugh. Indeed, Selkirk sent a team to the inaugural Melrose Sevens tournament back in 1883, and have been trying to win the Tournament ever since.The club has produced twelve Scotland internationalists and several British Lions, including John Rutherford and Ian Paxton, a very respectable amount when the size of the royal burgh is taken into consideration.Selkirk's youth system is set up through Schools rugby at Selkirk High School up until the 3rd year. Through 4th, 5th and 6th year players who wish to continue playing rugby join Selkirk Youth Club. Selkirk Youth Club has had a lot of recent success, being unbeaten league Champions in 2010 and winning the league again in 2012 with one defeat, Border Cup winners in 2011 and National U18 Cup finalists in 2011 and 2012. They also won the National U18 Cup in 2003.Selkirk's own Sevens takes place annually in May. First competed in 1919, the competition makes up part of the Kings of the Sevens tournament. Current holders of the trophy are Melrose RFC.
