VThe original Vermont Mozart Festival (1974-2010) was a series of indoor and outdoor concerts presented annually at sites throughout the state of Vermont. The Inaugural Festival of 1974 was conceived as a celebration of both the natural beauty of the state and the genius of the Festival's namesake, composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The Festival's mission quickly grew, and since its third season it featured performances of a much broader range of classical and other repertoire. In 2010 the original Vermont Mozart Festival disbanded and dissolved.In 2015 violinist Michael Dabroski announced a new Vermont Mozart Festival, Inc. and programs with its Title Sponsor NBT Bank, the City of South Burlington, and partnerships with community supporters including Burlington Country Club, South Burlington Rotary Club and others. The not-for-profit Vermont Mozart Festival aims to attract local, national and international attention for its quality artistic programs, community relevance, accessibility and unique business model. Beginning in 2016, Vermont Mozart Festival will produce many all-Mozart concert events year round, including a summer series of outdoor concerts and a three-week summer Fellowship Program between July 18-August 7, 2016 for thirty (30) awardees, who will perform the concert series while studying Mozart, writing business plans and staying at Champlain College.
