VCastle Point is a local government district with borough status in south Essex, 30 miles (48 km) east of central London. The borough comprises the towns and villages of Canvey Island, Hadleigh, South Benfleet, and Thundersley where the council has its headquarters.The national land use survey carried out for the following census in 2005 by the Office for National Statistics showed more than 50% (27.070 square kilometres (10 sq mi)) of the borough was in its non-gardens definition of green space: here a mixture of agricultural fields, natural marshland and sports grounds/courses and it had the second lowest area in England covered by non-domestic buildings: 0.55 square kilometres (0.21 sq mi). More than one fifth of the area, 9.6 square kilometres (3.7 sq mi), was made up of the second-highest category of use: gardens. The district ranked 295th in area of the 325 districts in England in area. The district relies heavily on other parts of Essex including factories and ports in Tilbury, the large town of Southend on Sea and on Central London for its largest sources of employment and as it has areas of seaside resort the median age of residents was in 2011 greater than the national average: 7% of its residents were aged 75 to 84 compared with 5.5% nationally.
