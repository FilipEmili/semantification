V"Booty" is a song recorded by American entertainer Jennifer Lopez for her eighth studio album, A.K.A. (2014). It was written and produced by Cory Rooney, Lopez, and Benny Medina, with additional writing from Chris Brown, Asia Bryant, Pitbull, Diplo, Lewis D. Gittus, Tedra Renee Wilson, and Danny Omerhodic. "Booty" samples "Dat a Freak", a song by Diplo and Swick, and it features Lopez's frequent collaborator Pitbull. It was released as the third single from the album on September 23, 2014. Initially entitled "Big Booty", the song was first rejected by Lopez who did not like the idea of having a song with a title like that. However, after playing the demo for her kids, they enjoyed the track and Lopez was convinced to record the track."Booty" is a dance track, with middle eastern vibe, heavy percussion and Oriental keyboard riff, while its lyrics portrait Lopez inviting girls to the dancefloor to have a good time and dance, while shaking their buttocks. The song received generally favorable reviews from music critics, with many complimenting the song's fun nature, the dance environment and Pitbull's appearance, but a few dismissed its concept. Commercially, "Booty" performed moderately worldwide. It became a top twenty hit in the United States, charting at number eighteen on the US Billboard Hot 100, and entered the top forty in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, among other music markets."Booty" was first premiered during a listening party Lopez threw for critics, later she performed a snippet of the track during a concert and eventually premiered it full at an Orchard Beach concert. She has also performed "Booty" on Good Morning America and at Fashion Rocks. A one-minute teaser clip for the track was released on June 13, 2014, and it features Lopez and a group of women twerking. The teaser-video received high praise for its visuals and choreography, while Lopez was complimented by critics for looking rejuvenated and younger."Booty" was officially remixed with vocals from Australian rapper Iggy Azalea, replacing those of Pitbull. The remix received generally positive reviews from critics, who commended Azalea for adding an explosive verse to the song. The music video for the remix was shot in Los Angeles in late August, and was directed by Hype Williams. It premiered on September 18, 2014, and it shows Lopez and Azalea dancing in revealing swimming costumes, before being drenched with water. Lopez and Azalea performed "Booty" for the first time together on live television at the American Music Awards on November 23, 2014.
