VGeorge Gordon Byron (later Noel), 6th Baron Byron, FRS (22 January 1788 \u2013 19 April 1824), commonly known simply as Lord Byron, was an English poet and a leading figure in the Romantic movement. Among his best-known works are the lengthy narrative poems Don Juan and Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, and the short lyric "She Walks in Beauty".Byron is regarded as one of the greatest British poets, and remains widely read and influential. He travelled extensively across Europe, especially in Italy where he lived for seven years. Later in life, Byron joined the Greek War of Independence fighting the Ottoman Empire, for which many Greeks revere him as a national hero. He died in 1824 at the young age of 36 from a fever contracted while in Missolonghi. Often described as the most flamboyant and notorious of the major Romantics, Byron was both celebrated and castigated in life for his aristocratic excesses, including huge debts, numerous love affairs \u2013 with men as well as women, as well as rumours of a scandalous liaison with his half-sister \u2013 and self-imposed exile.He also fathered Ada, Countess of Lovelace, whose work on Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine is considered a founding document in the field of computer science, and Allegra Byron, who died in childhood \u2014 as well as, possibly, Elizabeth Medora Leigh out of wedlock.
