VIn the Hebrew Bible and the Quran, Aaron \u05d0\u05b7\u05d4\u05b2\u05e8\u05b9\u05df  (UK /\u02c8\u025b\u0259r\u0259n/, US /\u02c8ær\u0259n/) was the older brother of Moses (Exodus 6:16-20, 7:7; Qur'an 28:34) and a prophet of God. Unlike Moses, who grew up in the Egyptian royal court, Aaron and his elder sister Miriam remained with their kinsmen in the eastern border-land of Egypt (Goshen). When Moses first confronted the Egyptian king about the Israelites, Aaron served as his brother's spokesman ("prophet") to Pharaoh. (Exodus 7:1) Part of the Law (Torah) that Moses received from God at Sinai granted Aaron the priesthood for himself and his male descendants, and he became the first High Priest of the Israelites. Various dates for his life have been proposed, ranging from approximately 1600 to 1200 BC. Aaron died before the Israelites crossed the Jordan river and he was buried on Mount Hor (Numbers 33:39; Deuteronomy 10:6 says he died and was buried at Moserah). Aaron is also mentioned in the New Testament of the Bible.

VIn the Hebrew Bible and the Quran, Aaron  (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05b7\u05d4\u05b2\u05e8\u05b9\u05df; /\u02c8ær\u0259n/ or /\u02c8\u025b\u0259r\u0259n/) was the older brother of Moses (Exodus 6:16-20, 7:7; Qur'an 28:34) and a prophet of God.Our knowledge of Aaron along with his brother Moses comes exclusively from religious texts such as the Bible and Quran. Since there is no independent corroboration for their lives, some scholars have regarded them as mythological constructs rather than historical figures. The Hebrew Bible relates that, unlike Moses, who grew up in the Egyptian royal court, Aaron and his elder sister Miriam remained with their kinsmen in the eastern border-land of Egypt (Goshen). When Moses first confronted the Egyptian king about the Israelites, Aaron served as his brother's spokesman ("prophet") to Pharaoh. (Exodus 7:1) Part of the Law (Torah) that Moses received from God at Sinai granted Aaron the priesthood for himself and his male descendants, and he became the first High Priest of the Israelites. Aaron died before the Israelites crossed the North Jordan river and he was buried on Mount Hor (Numbers 33:39; Deuteronomy 10:6 says he died and was buried at Moserah).
