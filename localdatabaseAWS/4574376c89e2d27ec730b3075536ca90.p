VThe Anglo-Scottish Cup was a tournament arranged for teams in the English and Scottish football leagues during the summer for several years during the 1970s. It was created in 1975 as a new incarnation of the Texaco Cup, with a similar format to its predecessor, but involving clubs from England and Scotland only.The competition made every attempt to maintain the status of a top-level tournament. Newcastle United were expelled from the 1976\u201377 competition for playing a weakened team in the first leg of their quarter-final against Ayr United. Over the years, however, English entrants were increasingly drawn from the lower divisions and in 1981 the Scottish clubs withdrew as the public showed little interest in the competition. As the final winners, Chesterfield still hold the trophy and it is displayed in their Board Room. The competition continued, with English clubs only, as the Football League Group Cup.In the 1987\u201388 season an attempt was made to revive the competition as the Anglo Scottish Challenge Cup, pitting the holders of the FA Cup and Scottish Cup against each other, but after a poor attendance for the first leg game between Coventry City and St Mirren, the competition was shelved, with the second leg never played.
