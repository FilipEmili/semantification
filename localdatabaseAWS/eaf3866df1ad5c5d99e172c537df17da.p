VWarren Jay Terhune (May 3, 1869 \u2013 November 3, 1920) was a United States Navy Commander, and the 13th Governor of American Samoa. Terhune was born in Midland, New Jersey, and lived in New Jersey most of his life when not posted elsewhere. He was appointed to the United States Naval Academy in 1889, and graduated as a Lieutenant in 1899. He was stationed on numerous ships, and held command of various ships and stations throughout his career. His most notable command posts include the Seventh Naval District of South Florida and the Naval Air Station Key West within his jurisdiction. His largest engagement came when President William Howard Taft ordered the United States Marine Corps to Nicaragua in an attempt to put down a rebellion there, primarily out of the city of Managua. Terhune commanded the USS Annapolis, which landed hundreds of troops to quell the violence and protect American civilians and property.On June 10, 1919, Terhune became the Governor of American Samoa; his governorship was wrought with problems and controversy. He revamped taxation on the island. He also took a number of steps to limit the power of the indigenous Samoans, believing they were not fit to govern themselves. He removed several local leaders from power, and outlawed marriages between United States Navy sailors and Samoan women. His actions helped lead to the anti-imperialistic Mau movement, stemming from perceived racism and a belief that the marriage law promoted anti-Christian promiscuity. In addition, his two executive officers sympathized with the Mau, leading his first to file a complaint with the Secretary of the Navy. An inquiry was launched to the island, but before it could get there, Terhune, plagued with depression and health problems, committed suicide by shooting himself through the heart on November 3, 1920 at noon. He is the only Governor of American Samoa to have died in office.
