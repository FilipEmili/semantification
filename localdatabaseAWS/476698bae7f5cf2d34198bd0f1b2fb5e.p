VTroy (Ancient Greek: \u03a4\u03c1\u03bf\u03af\u03b1, Troia and \u1f3c\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, Ilion, or \u1f3c\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, Ilios; Latin: Tr\u014dia and \u012alium; Hittite: Wilusa or Truwisa; Turkish: Truva) was a city situated in the far northwest of the region known in late Classical antiquity as Asia Minor, now known as Anatolia in modern Turkey, near (just south of) the southwest mouth of the Dardanelles straits and northwest of Mount Ida. The present-day location is known as Hisarl\u0131k. It was the setting of the Trojan War described in the Greek Epic Cycle, in particular in the Iliad, one of the two epic poems attributed to Homer. Metrical evidence from the Iliad and the Odyssey suggests that the name \u1f3c\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd (Ilion) formerly began with a digamma: \u03dc\u03af\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd (Wilion); this is also supported by the Hittite name for what is thought to be the same city, Wilusa.A new capital called Ilium was founded on the site in the reign of the Roman Emperor Augustus. It flourished until the establishment of Constantinople and declined gradually in the Byzantine era.In 1865, English archaeologist Frank Calvert excavated trial trenches in a field he had bought from a local farmer at Hisarl\u0131k, and in 1868, Heinrich Schliemann, a wealthy German businessman and archaeologist, also began excavating in the area after a chance meeting with Calvert in 크nakkale. These excavations revealed several cities built in succession. Schliemann was at first skeptical about the identification of Hisarlik with Troy, but was persuaded by Calvert and took over Calvert's excavations on the eastern half of the Hisarlik site, which was on Calvert's property. Troy VII has been identified with the Hittite city Wilusa, the probable origin of the Greek \u1f3c\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, and is generally (but not conclusively) identified with Homeric Troy.Today, the hill at Hisarl\u0131k has given its name to a small village near the ruins, which supports the tourist trade visiting the Troia archaeological site. It lies within the province of 크nakkale, some 30 km south-west of the provincial capital, also called 크nakkale. The nearest village is Tevfikiye. The map here shows the adapted Scamander estuary with Ilium a little way inland across the Homeric plain.Troy was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1998.
