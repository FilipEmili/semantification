VThe 2006 Cleveland Browns season was the team's 58th season as a professional sports franchise and its 54th season as a member of the National Football League (NFL). It began with the team attempting to improve upon their win-loss record from 2005, where the team ended the year at 6\u201310. They were one of the most active teams during the free agency period, and looked to be one of the most improved teams of the season at the end of the NFL Draft. They experienced many setbacks during training camp, from which they never fully recovered. By the end of the season they had gone 4\u201312, losing two more games than the previous season.
