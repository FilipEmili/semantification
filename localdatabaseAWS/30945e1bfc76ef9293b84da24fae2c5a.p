VLake Harris is a lake in Lake County, Florida, United States, 31 miles (50 km) northwest of Orlando. It is part of the "Upper Ocklawaha River Basin" a sub-basin of the St. Johns River. It is known by locals as the "Harris Chain of Lakes" or "Ocklawaha Chain of Lakes".Lake Harris is the largest lake entirely in Lake County, at 13,788 acres (56 km2) with an irregular shape when viewed from the air. An adjoining bay, Little Lake Harris, east of SR 19, is a smaller version of the lake. The combined area of the two lakes exceeds 15,000 acres (61 km2).The lake's northeastern shore is a landing approach zone for the Leesburg International Airport. It is a harbor city for Leesburg, at the northwestern shore of the lake. At the westernmost point of the lake is U.S. Route 27/SR 25. The road adjoins the lake to the east.Lake Harris primarily receives inflow, at its southwestern shore from the Palatlakaha River which originates from the Clermont Chain of lakes to the south. Other inflowing rivers include Helena Run, and outflow from many small springs in Yalaha.Lake Harris' depth is much greater than Lake Okeechobee to the south with many deeper holes and ledges. The lake is surrounded by sandhills and cypress trees. This is the part of Florida known as the 'Central Florida Ridge'. This region of Florida has the highest elevations in Central Florida, reaching 312' above sea level. Compared to the rest of Florida, which is relatively flat, it is quite hilly.There are three public launching ramps on Lake Harris; off of U.S. Route 27 to the west, Venetian Gardens in Leesburg and Hickory Point near the Howey-in-the-Hills bridge off SR 19. There is a small but serviceable ramp located on the east side of Little Lake Harris in the City of Astatula.The lake is ringed with cattail and bullrush, except for the occasional boat, dock, or seawall. The depth in these tall grasses normally ranges from 2\u20135 feet. The bottom is mostly hard sand except for some marshy areas where the bottom is considerably softer. These sheltered areas around the edge can offer a good place to fish during inclement weather.
