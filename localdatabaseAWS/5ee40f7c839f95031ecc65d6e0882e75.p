VProphecy involves a process in which one or more messages are allegedly communicated to a prophet by God or spirits and often are then communicated to other people. Such messages typically involve inspiration, interpretation, or revelation of events to come (compare divine knowledge). The Hebrew term for prophet Navi literally means "spokesperson" as he also speaks to God on behalf of the people. Prophecy is not accessible to the scientific method, therefore it is no object of science.

VProphecy involves a process in which one or more messages are allegedly communicated to a prophet by a god or spirit and often are then communicated to other people. Such messages typically involve inspiration, interpretation, or revelation of events to come (compare divine knowledge). Prophecy is not limited to any one culture. It is a common property to all known ancient societies around the world, some more than others. Many systems and rules about prophecy have been proposed over several millennia.
