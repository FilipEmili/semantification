VThe Core Cities Group (also Core Cities UK) is a self-selected and self-financed collaborative advocacy group of large regional cities in the United Kingdom and outside Greater London. The group was formed in 1995 as a partnership of eight city councils: Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham, and Sheffield. The Core Cities Group has wide ranging interests, encompassing transport and connectivity, innovation and business support, skills and employment, sustainable communities, culture and creative industries, climate change, finance and industry, and governance. During 2012 the first wave of 'city deals' recognised the eight cities as "the largest and most economically important English cities outside of (sic) London".Since 2010 British cities outside England have started consultations for incorporation into the group. In August 2014, Glasgow joined the group as the first non-English city, followed by Cardiff.A particular interest of the group is the High Speed 2 project to interlink the larger British cities faster.
