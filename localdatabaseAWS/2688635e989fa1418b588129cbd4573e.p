VThe Lakewood Church Central Campus (originally The Summit and formerly Compaq Center) is a house of worship in Houston, Texas. It is located about five miles southwest of Downtown Houston, next to the Greenway Plaza.From 1975 to 2003 the building served as a multi-purpose sports arena, for various professional teams in Houston.From its opening until 1998, the building was known as The Summit. Computer technology firm Compaq bought naming rights to the building after that and it was known as Compaq Center until 2003. At that point the name was dropped, coinciding with opening of the Toyota Center as a new professional sports venue in Houston. Shortly after, the building was leased out to Lakewood Church for use as its main facility. Lakewood Church purchased the building outright in 2010.
