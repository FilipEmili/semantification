VThe Bellefonte Nuclear Generating Station (shortly BLN) was a partially constructed nuclear power plant located in Hollywood, Alabama. A total of four nuclear reactors (two originally; and two of new designs), had been proposed for the site, over a period of 40+ years. And 4.0+ billion dollars have been spent (constructing the preliminary plant infrastructure and ordering/delivering/installing major equipment items. But no nuclear reactor nor electric generating plant was ever nearly completed; and no nuclear fuel was delivered or loaded. Meaningful construction progress at the site site was halted in 1988, and all of the site's major, useable, delivered systems (power transformers, steam generators, cooling water pumps, etc.) have been removed from the site, and used at other electric generating stations, as part of an "asset recovery" program.
