VEmmaus Bible College is an accredited, 4-year private college in Dubuque, Iowa affiliated with the Open Brethren. It offers double majors in both professional and biblical studies. It was established as Emmaus Bible School in 1941 in Toronto, Ontario, by Ed Harlow, John Smart, and Ernest Tatham. Emmaus began offering correspondence courses a year later, with the target audience being military personnel. The college relocated to Chicago, Illinois in 1947, and in 1984, it moved to where it is now located at 2570 Asbury Rd, Dubuque, Iowa. It was then renamed Emmaus Bible College.Emmaus has been a member of the Evangelical Training Association (ETA) since 1956. The college is nationally accredited by the Association for Biblical Higher Education as well as regionally accredited by the Higher Learning Commission of NCA - a higher education center which aims to integrate biblical teaching with what it considers to be a Christian worldview in vocational and general studies. Emmaus is also a member of the Association of Christian Schools International and of the International Assembly for Collegiate Business Education.Around half of Emmaus Bible College students come from Brethren backgrounds, while the other half come from other evangelical backgrounds. Emmaus offers bachelor's degrees and associate degrees in Biblical and ministry-related fields as well as professional studies. Its programs of study include: Bible and Theology, Business Administration, Computer Studies, Counseling Psychology, Educational Ministries, Intercultural Studies, Music, Teacher Education, Nursing and a two-year college transfer degree with a double major in Bible. The College is in a large facility that was formerly home of Aquinas Institute of Theology, a Roman Catholic institution.

One of its sister organizations, ECS Ministries, offers correspondence courses in 105 countries and in 125 languages.
