VInternational Artists (IA) was an independent record label based in Houston, Texas that originally existed from 1965 to 1970.During its existence IA released 12 albums and 39 singles and was owned by a group of businessmen in Houston. Among its staff was producer Lelan Rogers, brother of country singer Kenny Rogers. The label is famous for its roster of well-known Texas psychedelic rock bands, including The 13th Floor Elevators, The Red Crayola and Bubble Puppy, as well as lesser known bands such as The Golden Dawn, Lost And Found and Endle St. Cloud. International Artists also released an album by blues guitarist Lightnin' Hopkins that featured session work by the 13th Floor Elevators' rhythm section.The label originally folded in 1971, but was revived by Lelan Rogers in 1978. Rogers released a box-set that reissued all 12 albums. In 1980 the double-LP Epitaph for a Legend (IA #13) reissued rare International Artists tracks from Roky Erickson's first band, The Spades, early demos by the Red Krayola, and forgotten relics from other Texas blues and psychedelic artists. A six-CD box set, The Best of International Artists, was released in 2003 and included the entire Epitaph compilation along with reissues of the debut albums by the Thirteenth Floor Elevators, Red Krayola, Lost & Found and Bubble Puppy.In 2008, now under the control of Charly Records, the label began to re-issue all of its past albums together with some rarities and previously unheard recordings, including a 10-CD box set dedicated solely to the Thirteenth Floor Elevators.
