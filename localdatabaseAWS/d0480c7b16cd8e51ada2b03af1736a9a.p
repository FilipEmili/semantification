VDalit, meaning "divided" in South Asia, is the self-chosen political name of castes in India which are "untouchable". Though the name Dalit has been in existence since the nineteenth century, the economist and reformer B. R. Ambedkar (1891\u20131956) popularised the term. Dalits were excluded from the four-fold Varna system and formed the unmentioned fifth varna; they were also called Panchama.Dalits consist of various groups across South Asia. They speak a variety of languages and practice various religions. Dalits form 16.6% of India's population according to the 2011 census.To prevent harassment, assault, discrimination and other criminal acts on Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, the Indian government enacted the Prevention of Atrocity (POA) act on 31 March 1995.In 1932, the British Raj recommended separate electorates to select leaders for Dalits in the Communal Award. When Mohandas Gandhi opposed this, negotiations produced the Poona Pact with B. R. Ambedkar.From its independence in 1947 and expanded in 1974, India provided jobs and educational opportunities for Dalits. By 1995, 17.2% of Government sector IVth class jobs were held by Dalits. In 1997, India elected Dalit K. R. Narayanan as the nation's President. Many social organisations have promoted better conditions for Dalits through education, healthcare and employment. While caste-based discrimination was prohibited and untouchability abolished by the Constitution of India, such practices continued.Dalits and similar groups are found throughout South Asia, in India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. Dalits emigrated to the United States, United Kingdom, Singapore, Malaysia, South Africa, Canada and the Caribbean.
