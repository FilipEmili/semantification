VYorkshire Carnegie (formerly Leeds Carnegie, Leeds Tykes and Leeds RUFC) are an English rugby union club in Leeds, West Yorkshire, England, who play in the RFU Championship.The club was founded in 1991 as Leeds RUFC. In 1998, the club merged with Leeds Rhinos to form Leeds Rugby Limited, also known as Leeds Tykes. In 2007, Leeds Metropolitan University bought a 51% stake in the club and changed the name to fit with the university's sport department, Carnegie College. At the end of the 2008\u201309 season, ownership of the club passed back into the hands of Leeds Rugby.Leeds have bounced between the Premiership and the second-level National Division One, now known as the RFU Championship; they were either promoted or relegated in four consecutive seasons starting in 2006. Leeds were relegated from the Premiership as bottom finishers in 2006, promoted as National Division One champions in 2007, relegated again from the Premiership in 2008, and promoted a second time as National Division One champions in 2009. They managed to stay in the Premiership in the 2009\u201310 season, which helped to secure their financial future; starting with the 2010\u201311 season, they will become a full shareholder in Premier Rugby, the company behind the Premiership. In 2009\u201310, they only received 60% of a full share of Premiership revenues.
