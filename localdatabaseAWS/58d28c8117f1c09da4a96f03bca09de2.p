VThe Sporting Chance Clinic is a registered British based charity, first set up by former Arsenal and England football captain Tony Adams to provide a specialist addiction and recovery facility for athletes.Formed in September 2000, the charity provides support, counselling, treatment, and aftercare to sportsmen and women who are suffering from addictive illnesses such as alcoholism, drug abuse, compulsive gambling and eating disorders; and all the side effects, including anxiety and depression.Based at Forest Mere Country Club near Liphook, Hampshire, the system is based on the twelve-step program of Alcoholics Anonymous. The aim is to provide a safe environment where the addict can begin a new life free from the drug or behaviour pattern that has been damaging them, their families and their sporting life. The philosophy is based on Adams's own experiences of his requirements as an athlete in his own recovery from alcoholism: the unity of mind, body, and spirit.The patrons include ex-Sports Minister Kate Hoey, football manager Alex Rae and musician Sir Elton John. Adams's former Arsenal and England team mate Paul Merson, himself a former attendee and recovering alcoholic, is also now a patron of the charity. The clinic is supported by the Professional Footballers' Association.On 27 September 2013, it was announced that co-founder Peter Kay had suddenly died aged 52.
