They play at Kenilworth Road stadium, which has been their home since 1905.London Luton Airport, opened in 1938, is one of England's major airports. During the Second World War it doubled as an RAF base.The University of Bedfordshire is based in the town.The Luton Carnival, which was traditionally been held on the Whitsun May bank holiday, is the largest one-day carnival in Europe. In 2012, it was moved to July to coincide with the Olympic Torch Relay and celebrations. Luton Carnival was transferred from Luton Borough Council to UK Centre for Carnival Arts in 2013, and since then has been held on the Bank Holiday Sunday instead in order to save the enhanced costs of operating on a bank holiday.The town was for many years famous for hat-making, and was also home to a large Vauxhall Motors factory; the head office of Vauxhall Motors is still situated in the town. Car production at the plant began in 1905 and continued until 2002, where commercial vehicle production remains.
