VThe R10 was the first series of post-war New York City Subway car class built by the American Car and Foundry Company in 1948 and 1949. These cars were nicknamed Thunderbirds by their operating personnel and rail fans because they were very fast trains. The R10s were mainly assigned to the IND Eighth Avenue Line's A train from 1948 thru early 1978, when they were replaced by the slant-ended R40 cars transferred from Jamaica Yard's E, F, and N lines which in turn were receiving brand new R46's during this period. They were reassigned from the A line to the rush hours only CC (now C) line, with some still remaining on the B line effective April 1978 due to aging. Some were also transferred to Jamaica Yard for use on the GG line, and help fill a car shortage created by the R46 truck problems which was in its infancy stage at the time.The R10 cars were originally numbered 1803\u20131852 (later renumbered 2950\u20132999 in 1970) and 3000\u20133349. They first ran in service on the A service on November 20, 1948. They were initially and exclusively assigned to the Eighth Avenue Express A train where they remained for almost 30 years and became synonymous with that route from 1948 to 1969 when some brand new R42 cars were designated and directly assigned to the A line to give the A train some air-conditioned cars.The R10's displaced from the A train by the R42's were given to the B train to help replace their aging R1's on that line. Also, some were operated on the old pre-1967 rush hours only BB, and on the 1967 newly extended B to Coney Island via the BMT West End Line as well, when spare trains were available from 207th Street Yard. Some R10's also found their way onto the AA line during this period.Initially fifty cars (3300-3349) were transferred to the BMT Eastern Division in 1954 to help familiarize crews with SMEE equipment in anticipation of the arrival of the R16 cars. Then twenty cars (3300-3319) were returned to the IND for the opening of the IND Rockaway Lines during 1956, leaving only thirty R10 cars from 3320-3349 operating on the BMT Eastern Division's #15 Jamaica Line until 1961 when new R27/30's cars were delivered to the New York City Transit System's BMT Lines, which in turn replaced and released these loaned R10 cars to be sent back to the IND Division's A line.Again, beginning in early 1979 when the R46's truck problems started to escalate out of hand, forty-eight (48) R10's from the 3050-3099 group were directly transferred to the BMT Eastern Division to be operated exclusively on the LL 14th Street-Canarsie Local until early 1984. These R10 trains did not have the proper signage for the LL train line. This freed-up their R27/30's that were sent to the Concourse Yard for the D line, which replaced their R44 cars which were sent to Jamaica Yard to replace the R46's that were taken out of service because of severely cracked trucks.While they may have been considered the second worst operating revenue service car during the 1980s based on MDBF (Mean Distance Between Failures), doing better than the R46 based on MDBF, many R10s outlasted the newer R16s as well as a number of R27s and R30s. There was a light overhaul program between December 1984 and February 1986 which was an interim measure to get the entire fleet in a non-graffiti state. The rehabilitation of the 110 R10s was done in-house at a budgeted cost of $65,000 per car.
