VA high-speed craft (HSC) is a high speed water vessel for civilian use, also called a fastcraft or fast ferry. The first high-speed craft were often hydrofoils or hovercraft, but in the 1990s catamaran and even monohull designs have become popular. Most high-speed craft serve as passenger ferries, but the largest catamarans and monohulls also carry cars and even buses and freight (e.g. Stena's HSS). Hulled designs are often powered by pump-jets coupled to medium speed diesel engines. Hovercraft are usually powered by gas turbines or diesel engines driving propellors and impellors.The design and safety of high-speed craft is regulated by the High Speed Craft Codes of 1994 and 2000, adopted by the Maritime Safety Committee of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO).In accordance with SOLAS Chapter X Reg. 1.3, High Speed Crafts are crafts capable of a maximum speed, in metres per second (m/s), equal to or exceeding:                    3.7        ×                  \u25bd                      0.1667                                {\u005cdisplaystyle 3.7\u005ctimes \u005ctriangledown ^{0.1667}}  where:                     \u25bd              {\u005cdisplaystyle \u005ctriangledown }   = volume of displacement in cubic metres corresponding to the design waterline, excluding craft of which the hull is supported clear above the water surface in non-displacement mode by aerodynamic forces generated by ground effect.
