The curriculum runs twelve weeks, beginning with the two shorter terms the first full week of January followed by the final six-week third term.Students live in dormitories on the school campus, eat food served by the school's kitchen and study in the library. They spend free time in the lounge or the gym.All students are expected to participate in chorus, where they practice hyms or Gospel singing, entirely a cappella.
