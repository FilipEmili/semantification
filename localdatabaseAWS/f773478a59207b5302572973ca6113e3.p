VThe Meldon Viaduct is a railway bridge built in 1871 to carry the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) across the West Okement River at Meldon (near Okehampton) on Dartmoor in Devon, South West England, under the direction of the LSWR's chief engineer, WR Galbraith. It was constructed of wrought iron and cast iron and is one of many truss bridges remaining. It is unusual in the trusses also being supported on wrought iron lattice piers and is one of only two such railway bridges remaining in the United Kingdom, the other being Bennerley Viaduct between Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire.The viaduct had an axle load limit, which limited the class of locomotive permitted to operate over it.The bridge survives on a cycle track known as The Granite Way.

VMeldon Viaduct carried the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) across the West Okement River at Meldon (near Okehampton) on Dartmoor in Devon, South West England. The truss bridge, which was constructed from wrought iron and cast iron not stone or brick arches, was built under the direction of the LSWR's chief engineer, WR Galbraith. After taking three years to build, the dual-tracked bridge opened to rail traffic in 1874. Usage was limited to certain classes of locomotive because the viaduct had an axle load limit. Although regular services were withdrawn in 1968, the bridge was used for shunting by a local quarry. In the 1990s the remaining single line was removed after the viaduct was deemed to be to weak to carry rail traffic.The crossing is now used by The Granite Way, a long-distance cycle track across Dartmoor. The viaduct, which is a Scheduled Monument, is now one of only two such surviving railway bridges in the United Kingdom that uses wrought iron lattice piers to support the cast iron trusses (the other is Bennerley Viaduct between Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire).
