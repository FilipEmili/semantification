VJody McBrayer (born June 25, 1970) is an American singer/songwriter. A former member of the Christian pop group Avalon, with whom he recorded and toured with for nearly 12 years, he departed the group in 2007 due to a rare but manageable form of the heart disease hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.He has released one solo album on Sparrow Records titled This Is Who I Am in 2002. One of the tracks "Never Alone" featured Jadyn Maria. He also topped the Christian radio charts with the song To Ever Live Without Me. In interviews regarding that album, he states that the death of his father, Clyde "Sonny" McBrayer, on September 13, 2000 was an inspiration for the album. McBrayer states, "My father's passing brought a moment of revelation. I returned home with so much on my heart and a vision for how to express it. Though Avalon has a common mission statement, these are feelings too personal for a group."  His final collaboration with Avalon was the album Another Time, Another Place. Its songs include singles like Sandi Patty and Wayne Watson's duet "Another Time, Another Place," El Shaddai by Amy Grant, "For The Sake of the Call" by Steven Curtis Chapman and First Call's "The Reason We Sing." He is married to Stephanie Harrison and has one daughter, Sarah Clayton McBrayer, born in 2005.McBrayer released Keep Breathing, on February 12, 2016, with StowTown Records.
