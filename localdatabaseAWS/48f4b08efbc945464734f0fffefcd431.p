He played both football and hurling with Kerry from the 1950s till the 1970s, winning All Ireland and National League titles in both. He was also a successful dual player at club level winning county championships in both codes.Club careerCulloty played his club football with the Killarney Legion club as well as the East Kerry team. With East Kerry he won 4 County championship and 2 Munster Championship titles.He played hurling with the Killarney and St Patrick East Kerry teams. Over the course of career he won 1 County hurling championship, 3 minor championships and 4 Intermediate championships.Intercounty careerCulloty first played with Kerry when he lined out in goal for the county minor hurlers when he was just 14 in a Munster Championship game with Limerick. He later joined the county minor football panel where he won a Munster Championship in 1954. That same year he was part of the Kerry junior side that won both Munster and All Ireland titles.The following year he joined the senior team. Although more known as a goalkeeper his first game was as a forward when he came on as a sub in that years Munster final win over Cork. He kept his place for the rest of the year finishing off with a win over Dublin in the final.He would play as an outfield player for the league campaigns 1956, 58 and beginning of 59. It was in the second game of the 59 league in a game with Galway that he first lined out in goal, a position he would keep until his retirement after the 1971 championship.He would go on to have great success in his new position. The year started out well as Kerry won the National League for the first time since 1932. He played his first championship game in 4 seasons when he lined out in the first round of the 1959 championship, where Kerry easily overcame Tipperary and would go on to win the Munster championship after a win over Cork in the final. The semi final was to be a repeat of the 55 final as Kerry took on Dublin, the result was also a repeat with Kerry running out winners in the end. It then set up an All Ireland final with Galway won had been All Ireland champions only 3 years previous. In the end Kerry ran out 3-07 to 1-04 winners, giving Culloty his 2nd All Ireland medal.Kerry retained their Munster title in 1960 with easy wins over Tipperary and surprise finalists Waterford. It then set up a repeat of the previous years final with Galway in the semi, a game Kerry ran out winners on a 1-08 to 0-08 win. This set up an All Ireland final with first time finalists Down. Despite being favorites to retain their title Down picked up a surprise win to win a first title.Kerry started off the year by winning the National League for the 2nd time in 3 years and gave Culloty his 2nd league title. They once again retained their Munster title with wins over Clare and Cork in the Munster final but only after a replay. This set up a repeat of the previous years final but once again Down came out on top on rote to a second All Ireland in a row. Where Culloty may not have won an All Ireland in football he did in hurling, scoring 2 goals in the All-Ireland Junior Hurling Championship home final in Croke Park against Meath, Kerry went on to defeat London in the final proper.In 1962 Kerry and Culloty picked up a 4th Munster title in a row following easy wins over Waterford and Cork. This set up an All Ireland semi final with Dublin, a team Kerry hadn't played in Championship since 1959. In the end it was a repeat of that fixture with Kerry running out 2-12 to 0-10 winners in the end. This set up a novel pairing in the final as Roscommon qualified. It was to be third time the side met in the final and first since 1946. Going into the game each team had won one each but in the end Kerry ran out 1-12 to 0-06 winners to leap frog the Connacht in the head to head and in the process give Culloty his 3rd All Ireland title.1963 started off with Culloty picking up his 3rd National League title. Straight forward wins over Tipperary and Cork meant a 5th Munster title in a row. This set up an All Ireland semi final with Galway, a team Kerry and Culloty had had an upper hard over in the past. However much like 3 year before with Down Kerry were shocked as Galway pick up a 1-07 to 0-08 win on the way to an All Ireland title.In 1964 6th Munster title in a row was picked up after wins over Tipperary and Cork once more. This set up a first championship meeting with Cavan since 1955 in the semi final, with Kerry rinning out easy winning on a 2-12 to 0-06 scoreline. This set up an All Ireland final with defending champions Galway, however for the second year in a row victory went to the Connacht men on a 0-15 to 0-10 scoreline.1965 seen a 7th Munster title for Kerry after wins over Clare and for the first time since 1960 Cork weren't to be Kerrys opponents in the Munster final as they overcame Limerick, interestingly this was the first of only two meetings of the two side during Collotys playing career. Coully missed out on Kerrys semi final win over Dublin. He was back for the All Ireland final where for the third year in a row Kerry faced Galway and for the third year they were beaten, this time by 0-12 to 0-09.In 1966 Kerry were gong for an 8th Munster title in a row. They started off with a win over Tipperary but lost out to Cork in the final. This was to be Cullotys final year and to be only year to not make it outside of Munster.Culloty would play no part in both the league of Munster championship campaigns of 1967, a year where Kerry lost out once more to Cork in the Munster final.He would once again play no part in the 68 league or Munster championship. Kerry win the title for the final time in 2 years to set up a first championship meeting with first time Leinster Champions Longford. Culloty returned to the team as they ran out 2-13 to 2-11 winners. This set up an All Ireland final with Down. It was the first championship meeting between the sides since the 1961 semi final. In the end Down kept their 100% record against Kerry, a record that still stands today.1969 seen Culloty made Kerry captain. He led his side to a first league title since 1963, giving Culloty a 4th title. Wins over Waterford and Cork give him an 11th Munster title. The All Ireland semi set up a meeting with Mayo the result being a one-point win on a 0-14 to 1-10 score line for Kerry. Another novel pairing awaited in the final as Kerry fased Offaly for the final time. In the end Kerry ran out 0-10 to 0-07 winners giving Culloty the honor of accepting the cup as captain and a 4th All Ireland title.1970 seen Culloty pick up his 12th and what was to be his final Munster championship title as a player following wins over Limerick and Cork. Kerry had 13 points to spare in the semi final against Derry, setting up an All Ireland final meeting with Meath. In a highe scoring game Kerry ran out 2-19 to 0-18 winners giving Culloty his 5th and final All Ireland medal.In what was to be his last season as a player Culloty won a 5th National League title. Kerry began their Munster campaign with a win over Tipperary to set up a Munster final with Cork. However Kerry and Culloty ended up on the wrong side of a 0-15 to 0-14 scoreline.Durling his career he played in a number of Railway Cup campaigns with Munster but failed to win any titles with them. He also won 2 National Hurling League titles during his hurling career.Management careerIn 1972 only a year after retiring from playing he became manager of the Kerry team. He had mixed fortunes as a manager. In his first year in charge he won both National League and Munster titles, while ago leading his side to an All Ireland final against then championships Offaly. A 1-13 apace draw meant the sides would have to meet again. In the replay Kerry were totally outclassed and lost, on what is still a record All Ireland final loss for a Kerry team, on a 1-19 to 0-13 scoreline. Despite National League title in 1973-74, Cullotys side failed to make the breakthrough in Munster losing to Cork both years. Culloty stepped down as manager after the 1974 season being succeeded by former teammate Mick O'Dwyer
