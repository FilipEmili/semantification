In 1996 Automatic 7 contributed a cover version of the Psychedelic Furs 'Pretty in Pink' to the Vagrant Records V/A release 'Before You Were Punk' along with other various 80's themed covers by bands such as Blink 182 and Face to FaceIn 1997 Automatic 7 signed with A&M Records, the band recorded their second album at Long View Farm with legendary Producer Ron Saint Germain. However, as A&M prepared for the release of the second album, PolyGram (A&M Parent label) was bought by Seagram and merged with its MCA Records family to create Universal Music. A&M was subsequently merged into Universal Music Group's then newly formed Interscope-Geffen-A&M label group. All these changes left the band disenchanted with A&M and Automatic 7 split with the label, and the album was never released. However, Automatic 7 signed with Vagrant Records, which was owned and operated by the band's manager Rich Egan and released Beggar's Life on July 25, 2000.Between 2001 and 2006, Automatic 7 went on a hiatus. The band reformed in 2006, and released the album At Funeral Speed in 2007, on the independent label Mental Records. The album was well received and included a rendition of Bruce Springsteen's 'Atlantic City'. In 2008 Nifoussi and Ray Mehlbaum formed the Noise/Rock duo Killing Bees and subsequently released their self-titled debut on Guano loco/Loose Fang records.
