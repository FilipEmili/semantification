As a result, Chin is today one of the top teen artists in Thailand.Chin went to New York City to work on his album 'Maybe I'm Bad'.In the fall of 2008, Chin did a Malaysian commercial presenting a Sony Skinny T. For this commercial he recorded several of his songs in Chinese, including 'Term Mai Keuy Tem', 'Roo Chai Mai Wa Ruk' and more recently 'Keun Tee Neung'. He is now the presenter for Sony Skinny T Digital Camera in Malaysia and a singer of growing reputation in Malaysia as well.December 16, 2008 he released his second single album "Maybe I'm Bad" featuring his top 10 songs, "One Night Stand" or "Keun Tee Neung".
