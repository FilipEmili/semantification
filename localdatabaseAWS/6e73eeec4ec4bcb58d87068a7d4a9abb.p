VOrlando Lamar Pace (born November 4, 1975) is a former American college and professional football player who was an offensive tackle in the National Football League (NFL) for thirteen seasons. He played college football for The Ohio State University, and was twice recognized as an All-American. He was drafted by the St. Louis Rams, first overall in the 1997 NFL Draft, and played professionally for the Rams for twelve years. Pace started all 16 regular season games eight times in his pro career, and blocked for three straight AP NFL MVPs (Kurt Warner in 1999, 2001; and Marshall Faulk in 2000). He was the cornerstone of a Rams offensive line that blocked for an offense that compiled more gross yards than any other team during his 12 years in St. Louis (50,770 in 12 seasons), finished second in completion percentage (61.8 percent) and fifth in touchdown passes (289) over that time. Under Pace's protection, the Rams' passing offense compiled more than 3,000 yards in all 12 of his NFL seasons, seven different quarterbacks eclipsed the 3,000-yard mark in a season, including three times surpassing the 4,000-yard mark, and blocked for seven 1,000-yard rushers. Pace started 154 consecutive games.A five-time All-Pro and seven-time Pro Bowl selection, Pace earned a Super Bowl ring with the Rams in Super Bowl XXXIV. He has also played for the Chicago Bears. In 2016 Pace was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
