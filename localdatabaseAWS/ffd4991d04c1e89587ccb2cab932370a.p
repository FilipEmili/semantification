VThe PC 1715 was an office computer produced by VEB Robotron in East Germany starting in 1985. The system featured an 8-bit microprocessor, the U880, a clone of the Zilog Z80. It was built for office work and had minimal graphics and sound capabilities. The price was 19,000 East German marks.In 1987, a new version was produced, the PC 1715W (1715M in the Soviet Union). The system was identical to the PC 1715, except the processor was clocked at 4 MHz and the machine had 256KiB DRAM.In total, about 93,000 PC 1715 and PC 1715W units were manufactured.  An estimated 50,000 of those were exported to the Soviet Union.In March 1987, a stamp was issued by the German Democratic Republic featuring the PC 1715. 8 million copies were printed.
