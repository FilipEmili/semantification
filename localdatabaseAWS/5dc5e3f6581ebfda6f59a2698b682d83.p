VAmerican Horror Story is an American anthology horror television series created and produced by Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk. Described as an anthology series, each season is conceived as a self-contained miniseries, following a disparate set of characters and settings, and a storyline with its own "beginning, middle, and end." Some plot elements are loosely inspired by true events.The first season, retroactively subtitled Murder House, takes place in Los Angeles, California during the year 2011 and centers on a family that moves into a house haunted by its deceased former occupants. The second season, subtitled Asylum, takes place in Massachusetts during the year 1964 and follows the stories of the patients and staff of an institution for the criminally insane. The third season, subtitled Coven, takes place in New Orleans, Louisiana during the year 2013 and follows a coven of witches who face off against those who wish to destroy them. The fourth season, subtitled Freak Show, takes place in Jupiter, Florida during the year 1952 and centers around one of the few remaining American freak shows. The fifth season, subtitled Hotel, takes place in Los Angeles, California during the year 2015 and focuses on the staff and guests of a supernatural hotel. The only actors to appear in all iterations of the show so far are; Evan Peters, Sarah Paulson, and Lily Rabe.The series is broadcast on the cable television channel FX in the United States. The fifth season premiered on October 7, 2015, and concluded on January 13, 2016. On November 10, 2015, the show was renewed for a sixth season; set to premiere, for the first time out of October, September 14, 2016.American Horror Story has been well received by television critics, with the majority of the praise going to the cast, particularly Jessica Lange, who won two Emmy Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and a Screen Actors Guild Award for her performances.
