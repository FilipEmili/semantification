VHMS Levant was a 28-gun Coventry-class sixth-rate frigate of the Royal Navy, which saw active service in both the Seven Years' War and the American Revolutionary War.Launched in 1758 during a period of war with France, Levant was assigned to the Royal Navy's Caribbean station and proved her worth by defeating ten enemy-controlled vessels during her first three years. She was also part of the fleet for the British expedition against Martinique in 1762 but played no role in the landings or subsequent defeat of French forces at Fort Royal.She was decommissioned following Britain's declaration of peace with France in 1763, but returned to active service during the American Revolutionary War. For this conflict she was assigned to the Mediterranean as part of a small British squadron based at Gibraltar. Over the next three years she captured or sank a total of fourteen enemy craft including an 18-gun American privateer.The ageing frigate was again decommissioned in 1779 and her crew discharged to other vessels. She was broken up at Deptford Dockyard in 1780, having secured a total of 24 victories over 21 years at sea.

Launched in 1758 during a period of war with France, Levant was assigned to the Royal Navy's Jamaica station and proved her worth in defeating nine French vessels during her first three years at sea. She was also part of the fleet for the British expedition against Martinique in 1762 but played no role in the landings or subsequent defeat of French forces at Fort Royal.She was decommissioned following Britain's declaration of peace with France in 1763, but returned to active service during the American Revolutionary War. For this conflict she was assigned to the Mediterranean as part of a small British squadron based at Gibraltar. Over the next three years she captured or sank a total of fourteen enemy craft including an 18-gun American privateer. In 1779 she brought home news of an impending Spanish assault on Gibraltar, ahead of Spain's declaration of war on Great Britain. The ageing frigate was again decommissioned later that year and her crew discharged to other vessels. She was broken up at Deptford Dockyard in 1780, having secured a total of 24 victories over 21 years at sea.
