VTatjana Patitz is a German fashion model and actress who achieved international prominence in the 1980s and 1990s representing top fashion designers on runways and in magazines such as Elle magazine, Harper's Bazaar and Vogue magazine. Patitz is one of the original "big five" supermodels who appeared in the iconic 1990s music video "Freedom! '90" by George Michael and is most often associated with the editorial, advertising and fine art works of photographers Herb Ritts and Peter Lindbergh. In 2012, Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, who was named the most influential woman in fashion by Forbes, declared that Patitz has always been one of her favorite models. In her 2012 memoir, creative director of Vogue, Grace Coddington regarded Patitz as one of the original supermodels and a "must" in photographs and on the catwalk. Harper's Bazaar wrote, "Indeed, Patitz's features almost confuse. Like Garbo or the Mona Lisa, the inexplicable gifts of line and luminescence defy definition." In his 2015 book Models of Influence: 50 Women Who Reset The Course of Fashion, Nigel Barker (photographer) reflected on Patitz's prolific years as a fashion model. He wrote that during the height of the 1980s and 90s supermodel era, Patitz's exotic beauty set her apart from her peers and that she projected a broad range of emotions - sensuality, mystery, and serenity. Such qualities made Patitz's work standout, her iconic career bridging the eras of the exhibitionist 1980s and the minimalist 1990s in a unique and enduring way: "The most lasting images of her are when she was really looking like herself," concluded Barker.Today, Patitz, who grew up an athletic tomboy swimming and riding horses, is an avid horsewoman who continues her lifelong passion for animals and the environment by campaigning for ecological causes and animal rights. Her self-described eclectic and bohemian design aesthetic for residential architecture and home design in her adoptive home state of California has been recognized internationally.
