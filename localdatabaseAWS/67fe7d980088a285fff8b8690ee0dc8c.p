VThe Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim are an American professional baseball team based in Anaheim, California. The Angels compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) West division. The Angels have played home games at Angel Stadium of Anaheim since 1966. The "Angels" name was continued by former film star Gene Autry out of tribute for the Los Angeles Angels, a Minor League franchise in the Pacific Coast League (PCL), which played in South Central Los Angeles from 1903 to 1957. The current Major League franchise was established as an expansion team in 1961 by Autry, the team's first owner, who bought the rights to the Angels name from Walter O'Malley, the former Los Angeles Dodgers owner, who acquired the PCL franchise from Philip K. Wrigley, the owner of the Chicago Cubs at the time.In 2009, the Angels won the AL West division championship for the third straight season. 2013 was the fourth straight year in which the team did not qualify for the postseason, but marked the 11th straight year in which the Angels franchise drew more than 3 million fans in attendance, and made 30 seasons of at least 2 million fans in attendance.
