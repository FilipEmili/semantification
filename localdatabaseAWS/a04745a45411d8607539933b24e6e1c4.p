VDonnchadh Walsh (born 3 July 1984) is an Irish Gaelic footballer. A midfielder and forward, he plays his football with the Cromane club, the Mid Kerry divisional side and the Kerry county panel.Walsh was described as a 'star' and a 'teen sensation' for Kerry in the All-Ireland Minor Football Championship. He won the Munster Minor Football Championship with Kerry in 2001  and 2002. He was first selected for the senior squad in 2003. Despite his status as a highly promising player, Walsh did not make the breakthrough to All-Ireland Senior Football Championship football with Kerry until 2008. However, he was being tipped to do following an excellent 2007 season in the Kerry Senior Football Championship with Mid Kerry. He was also given his chance in the National Football League 2008. His first Munster Senior Football Championship game came in the final of July 2008. Walsh started and scored 1\u20131, but Cork defeated Kerry with a second-half comeback. The following year he won his first All-Ireland Senior Football Championship medal after Kerry beat Cork. Five years later Kerry defied all odds to claim their 36th All-Ireland in an amazing year and Walsh was exceptional throughout the whole season. But the one thing that eluded him was an All-Star. How he didn't win one between 2009-2014 was one of the most baffling mysteries in the GAA. Finally, in 2015, he got a fully deserved All-Star. His incredible work ethic when playing for kerry was finally rewarded.
