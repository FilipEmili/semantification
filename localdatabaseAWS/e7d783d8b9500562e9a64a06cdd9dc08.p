VCastillon-la-Bataille is a commune in the Gironde department in Aquitaine in southwestern France.This area was the site of the last battle of the Hundred Years' War, the Battle of Castillon, fought July 17, 1453. Castillon-la-Bataille, on the Dordogne river, saw the battle in which John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, ("The Frenchman's only scourge, Their kingdom\u2019s terror, and black Nemesis."), hemmed in by a French force, was slain at the age of nearly 80 years, along with his son, John Talbot, 1st Viscount Lisle. His father had in vain counselled him to depart out of the field, seeing that all was lost. This real incident was dramatised by Shakespeare in Henry VI, Part 1. The result of Talbot's defeat and death was the capture of Bordeaux from the English, and their final expulsion from Guyenne. Near La Mothe-Montraval, on the right bank of the Dordogne, a tumulus is pointed out under the name of Talbot's tomb; but it is known that his body was removed by his friends to St Alkmund's Church, Whitchurch, in Shropshire in England.On November 27, 1953, the name of the town was changed from Castillon-sur-Dordogne to its current name.
