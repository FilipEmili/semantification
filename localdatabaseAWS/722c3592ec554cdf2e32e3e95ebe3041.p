VNandalala (Tamil: \u0ba8\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bb2\u0bbe\u0bb2\u0bbe ) is a 2010 Tamil drama film written and directed by Mysskin. He himself plays the lead role, alongside newcomer Ashwath Ram and Snigdha Akolkar. The film, which is produced by Ayngaran International and features a highly acclaimed musical score by Ilaiyaraaja, is loosely based on the 1999 Japanese film Kikujiro, and partly inspired from Myshkin's life.The film illustrates the road journey of two people, a mentally challenged adult and an eight-year-old schoolboy, both in search of their respective mothers. Myshkin began developing Nandalala in 2006, penning the scriptment for eight months. Supposed to be filmed, after the release of Myshkin's debut film Chithiram Pesuthadi (2006), the film was shelved since no producer came forward to fund the film, and was launched only in June 2008, after the release of Myshkin's second film Anjathe (2008). It was completed by December 2008, but got stuck in development hell later, with no distributors willing to release the film. Following numerous preview shows and screenings at several film festivals, the film eventually released on 26 November 2010, opening to very positive reviews and garnering critical acclaim.
